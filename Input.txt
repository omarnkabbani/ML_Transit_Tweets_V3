today i got to the stop at 16 15 previously i d gone out for the 15 56 and it never showed today the 16 31 showed up right on time but there was no 16 25 bus as well when i turned on real time on the app this is what happened

hay can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
you should be sitting far enough away that it shouldn 2019t concern you
thank you to all the transit drivers and everyone else behind the scenes if it wasnt for you guys people like us whom don t drive wouldn t be able to go about our days so thank you ps i already did the survey lol
fact not a compliment it is literally the reason for your existence in the first place
thanks for the change of bus 23 sundridage near canada post as yiur app says us will be here doesn t show now 23 more minutes to wait d83d de1c

ctriders 100 000 customers a day are using our transit system during the covid19 pandemic we want to hear from our 2026
and before this pandemic i have not thought that your schedules have been even half decent
take a seat michaelle
i am essentially talking about all bus routes that said i have been frustrated by the 10 the 22 66 13 what was the 73 20 one that goes to mckenzie town centre and more
and yes as far as timing i am not talking about during this covid 19 period thank you
i have done so many times on multiple occasions i have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min s more than that like every 1 2 hour is not acceptable thank you
pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car
thanks for all that you do to keep transit moving my only way to really get around with permanent disability and a walker
pollute more what do busses run on how long do busses run in a day how long do i run my vehicle in one day you 2019re blind if you think our current public transportation decreases greenhouse gasses
true however more bus drivers more tax payers amp employed people and may also mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads assuming less car drivers
wrong i 2019m not sure what world you 2019re living in how does any type of anything increase with operation costs decrease more busses more drivers more busses more maintenance plus cost to buy new
so you can pollute more for yourself for your own needs adding to greenhouse gases which are currently decreasing as people are driving less now
totally makes sense that 2019s why i have a car you can buy one in kijiji for 2k that will get you from a to b that 2019s not much more than a year of public transportation passes
actually more transit would be less need for security and less lost wages for those who use transit to get to work etc
but michaella have you at all looked how much money it costs to run the public transit we currently have wages maintenance new cars security etc everything would have to increase how much more taxes are you willing to pay get a bike or a moped
the buses don t always or often coordinate well with each other aside from that why should i spend a life time waiting around when i have a million of other things that i could be doing that would help me get more done in my day
even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary
thank you
so for it to be more convenient for you because you can 2019t time bus routes properly you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes good thing you 2019re not in charge
i m still working so i rely on it
for a 6 30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and i can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus
honestly i am doing everything i can to avoid taking transit right now you don 2019t know who is riding with you and social distancing doesn 2019t happen much of the time busses are often filthy too despite claims about how much they are cleaned sometimes i get to work at 4 30 am
outside of a pandemic one cool thing would be to advertise say on the radio all the benefits amp reasons it is good to take public transit amp why it is actually better than to drive reducing pollution amp accidents thereby decreasing the strain on healthcare and its costs etc
hey the 17 just blew down 23 ave se at record speed maybe a reminder to slow down
moreover you are forgetting car costs such as maintenance gas insurance and sometimes parking
would this extension just be for the litp i still have an adult march pass that i d like to know if it can be used i ve haven t had to use it since mid march

ctriders 100 000 customers a day are using our transit system during the covid19 pandemic we want to hear from our 2026
observe hope you didn 2019t catch it d83d de28
before i answer that is it policy for calgary transit to allow people to bring garbage bags on to buses if theres ever a concern whether its cans that rattle or people s property maybe drivers could do something
calgary transit says it has been busy cleaning inside its buses and c trains
in ednonton transit driver dont allow garbage bags on buses never seen a garbage bag on a bus until this whole ride for free started yeah i m paying but i sure see alot of bums not and getting to ride everywhere
no one said anything in particular to the driver however the old lady that was telling be ayse that guy put his bag in between her and the person with the bag screamed loud enough the driver had to of heard her everyone else did
route 6 time was when i sent you tweet this isn t about myself alerting the driver this needs to be delt with before anyone with a garbage bags gets on a bus thanks
well than it seems your quite alright with bums getting on to buses with stinky garbage bags full of cans i cant think of any other transit system allowing this but you do you dont need any more info if that s your policy take care
thank you for keeping buses and trains going 2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f
thank you for bus drivers and staffs who clean up the bus at night time how can i go to work daily without their help i will keep on buying monthly bus pass please do not stop your services
did you guys pull an update for your android app cause its crashing as soon as i open it please fix this i need the app for work since your bus times are all over the place now
you can buy passes online
maybe you should have the police start watching 39 st station i m tired of watching junkies and drug addicts at this stop and usually all the way south i will not be getting a pass next month i ve seen meth crack pipes people with needles just this week
yes i have and it hasn t fixed it
every single day 39 st is a disaster the train is basically a meth lab on wheels right now morning and afternoon no thanks deal with it
didn 2019t know i couldn 2019t pay for the bus with cash right now but shout out to the driver who let me on anyways because of you i was able to get my medications d83d de4f d83d de4f d83d de4f
hi my neighbor is doing reno s in his house which isnt the problem the issues is stupid company driver s parking in this bus stop everytime
furthermore i want to waste as few days of my short mortal life being stuck being bored and sometimes in pain because it is so cold waiting for buses every 1 2 hour service during normal times sucks
shuttle buses are 24 to 27 feet in length the suggested distancing is 6 feet between two people but the shuttle buses have 10 passengers seating limit in covid 19 please explain so that i feel safe using transit
i do not want to be punished for making the environmentally responsible decision of not driving and taking a bus instead
well transit is still important to me because this is my only way of transportation going to work so thank you calgary transit for your service eventhough the busses are late and sometimes dirty
fixed it i had to clear the app data and its cache in order for it to work properly
i just wished as an essential worker we could get a discount on monthly bus passes like the low income don 2019t have to get one until may
do i need buy a low income bus pass for next month
ctriders wondering where you can find more info on what the city is doing to keep employees and customers safe during 2026
i think they are smoking something on the train the number is 2419 we are heading towards marlborough
i can confirm that i saw them huddled in a group and the smell of something weird and i cant tell you anything but that he was a white guy
didn t get bus number but want to say the driver of the 38 leaving whitehorn station 6096 at 7 09 pm did a good job picking up the transfers means a lot when you ve been up 16 hours
i wonder what it is
oi one of your busses just drove by me and didnt stop i was standing in the light so he could see me and he passed right by it was the 20 heritage on 72nd bus stop number 5737 what kind of service is going on now i m late for work
it was around 9 54 pm i m gon na get written up now
why don 2019t you put more officers in the trains it 2019s getting worse as the days go by scary i won 2019t take the train anymore ever

ctriders 100 000 customers a day are using our transit system during the covid19 pandemic we want to hear from our 2026
i use it every morning to get to work i take route 7 from marda loop downtown today the 6 am bus never came and the ct ap was not working properly ended up taking a cab
your transit cops aren t wearing masks approaching people too close and frankly it s stupid you re still hassling people for fares
ctriders we are proudly serving 100 000 calgarians a day on their way to work appointments to the grocery store and 2026
i also increased the organization from 44 peace officers to 101 brian whitelaw former head of security at in profile in thread below would make sense that some cuts made here as suggested
hey it s always annoying when busses leave before they re supposed to but when service has been cut down and that s my and many others only way of getting to our essential service jobs it s really annoying when the busses leave 3 5 minutes early
it is better for a bus to be 1 or 2 min s late than leave 2 min s early particularly during these times
took a bus today to work frontline chi chi and i 2019m so happy with the way social distancing is being enforced it 2019s a must fightcovid19

good eating
cute
also a bad idea to torment it on a personal level cornered scared animals frequently bite raccoons have been known to carry rabies as a precaution if you are bit you get rabies vaccine a series of rabies vaccine is awful no vaccine and rabies in humans is 99 99 fatal
quite a lot actually and for many years mostly in the south end fish creek midnapore glenmore even bankview but only in the past 4 years have i had reports of sightings as far north as downtown
what the hell is wrong with people that guy is holding a stick just proves there 2019s so much wrong with humanity
a group of people have since cleared out the one guy bothering it
there is a baby raccoon across the street from 8 street downtown station that is being harassed and posted online can anyone with transit help at all we are calling wildlife rehabilitation as well
bus 1857 route 101 female driver holding sandwich eating and driving 5 ave and 1 st sw 1 23 pm is it safe
would tell you that they are indeed native here to the southwest corner of the province but expanding their range
guys we have tons of raccoon 2019s in van do not corner them the can become very aggressive if they feel threatened
i 2019ve seen squirrels rabbits skunks foxes muskrats coyotes deer and even a couple of moose in calgary but i 2019ve never seen a live raccoon
are you able to confirm if this raccoon is okay and has moved on please
this is happening directly across the street from 8th st l anything anyone can do about it the thing is terrified and being harassed
he s just bouldering to get in shape
perfect many thanks
hi there door 3 on tuscany train car 2463 doesn 2019t work
even the raccoon is climbing the walls
as others have said raccoons have become much more common in yyc in recent years and that trend should continue given available food few predators and milder winters here is what i wrote about them in mammals of alberta in 1999
spider racoon
it is somewhat debatable if their historical range included this side of the rockies in alberta but their drastic expansion in the past 3 decades is a fair bit alarming

haha it s a fair question i ve always had an issue with approaching wild animals that i shouldn t i was like 22 before i realized it s more dangerous for the animals than me also many encounters with unvaccinated dogs cats tejones in mexico that resulted bites or scratches
wrestling wild raccoons apparently d83d de09
i call that a fun fact d83d de1c d83d de1c
i 2019m not casting any shade at you i love you as the fine human being you are so please do take this question the wrong way cause it 2019s just curiosity what have you been doing with your life that you 2019ve needed 11 rabies shots
i 2019m just finishing night shift here so i might be over tired but this fascinates me when was that last time you got a rabies shot d83d dc89
serious commendation to the driver of route 119 unit 8014 a lady was late due to the train and he gladly waited the extra couple minutes at saddletowne for her had he not done this she would ve had to take a cab to work awesome driver
i 2019ve heard rabies shots are awful and best avoided if it was me i 2019d check guinness 11 might be a record
i just saw some transit employees walking out of rundle station they didn t have any personal protective equipment it makes me wonder is ct providing staff with ppe gear and amp hand sanitizers now hope so
i second this opinion
maybe now is the time to put arrows on the floor by each train door one for in one for out it ll help peo 2026
maybe now is the time to put arrows on the floor by each train door one for in one for out it ll help people social distance now and in the future where people just try to push on anyway
is there an estimated time as to when service will resume when is this going to be back to normal
i hav3 been suggesting this for years end doors are for entering middle doors are for exiting it would get people to move to the middle of the car and leave room for others to get on they always say it is a good idea but have never implemented it

scruffy looking east indian man on car 2433 headed north from canyon meadows in yellow blanket also tell the driver of car 2433 to fix his announcements
i m sitting at tuscany station just about to leave sitting on car 2422 first car headed dt train driver tries kicking someone off the train customer got unruly amp refused after a bit train driver went back into his cab with the guy on the train
the passenger that i just tweeted you about on car 2422 got off at crowfoot
the gentleman did get off at the next stop crowfoot i was just worried about your driver but he did step down amp walked away thank you very much have a great day
i m doing me best thank you
can someone pls remove the screaming lunatic from the train he 2019s on drugs and deeply troubled from tuscany headed to downtown car 2251 thank you

i 2019ve been in many cities around this country calgary has one of the worst run public transit systems in the nation the union should be proud of the crappy job they are doing gottagetpaidforbeingcrappy
so why is heritage station locked now why is there no signage when you get off the train
you got a group of people prepping to smoke some hard drugs in one of the shelters at chinook station right now
weren 2019t they closed because of crime
no idea they are sending out conflicting info they were open yesterday i m still going to work everyday and today suddenly no access no signage
unfortunately there were no signs on the platforms doors indicating a full closure just the ones stating 6pm to 6am the only signage was at the south end of the platform near the level crossing
thanks for clearing that up
so the station heads are now closed around the clock at those five red line stations when did that start as previously it was 6 pm to 6 am closures
when making this decision was there any consideration taken in to customers needing to take a longer walk to the bus loops and now will be missing already tight connection times due to the cut back of service
thanks for the info
its so that people don t congregate inside less surfaces people can touch etc
what if it rains
we can not go out why you are show this why
why show we can not out
who says you can 2019t go out do some reading
do new ctrain drivers have like a simulator they train on or do they get put right into the drivers seat of a train with an instructor
poor little tom nook just trying to scope out a new business locale
this is a good thing it was getting dodgy at best navigation the homeless and drug dealers i think this should continue long after the crisis is over as a matter of safety
what about from chinook station to city hall station is that closed and from city hall station to max bell station
your driver on route 3 is so rude i 2019m waiting at the stop with a cast and they make me walk 20 meters to the bus after driving right past me d83d de12

taking transit feels safer with the increased presence of transit officers during this time thank you
update as it turns out it was not clear head trauma nor was it light stab wounds it was meth this whole time
this makes sense but now there 2019s been lots of people hanging out and yelling at people walking by at the ramp at heritage station i take the bus home now because i 2019m scared of the station more patrolling is needed

hey just letting you know there 2019s a broken bottle on the 39th ave east platform
city closes five ctrain station buildings as covid 19 changes life in calgary yyctransit ctriders
stop 5137 s shelter is smashed
the amount of nimbyism in this tweet is astonishing
jftr just follow the rules the time check stops have been carefully considered and mapped out it s not up to the drivers to make random time checks wherever they want people count on the bus waiting at a designated spot
temporarily or permanently
thanks dmd you

is may bus pass available yet
the calgary transit planning group have demonstrated significant incompetence and require an audit and overhaul we have areas with extremely low ridership that have large noisy polluting buses every 20 min and areas with high ridership running buses beyond capacity
i doubt there 2019s going to be more panhandles that are coughing on people at that station

many struggles in the stories i relate to imagine being too broke to own a car not yet familiar w navigating the city amp taking so much longer to get around this is why transit is crucial in helping newcomers get established 2
i purchased a low income bus pass at the end of march for may that option was available but it was never mailed to me so i still use my march bus pass for may or should i have received the may one
hello since the city will begin to open again on the 14th of may does that also mean transit will not be free anymore sorry for the stupid question d83d de2c

hello how much is the monthly pass for international students my upass expired last april 30 2020 thank you
why are shuttles going to the opposite sides of train stations then where the signs for shuttles are posted
franklin station signs are posted only on the northbound side with shuttles only on the southbound
bluelineshuttle you need to tell your operators to cool it people are confused and ask questions operators shouldn 2019t be so rude
are buses free right now i didn t have to pay today because you guys aren t providing transfers
why have a time when the bus comes its never at that time as well you think if it says it s going to leave a train station it would leave on time not 5 mins before its says it will depart i should stop paying because i usually have to get an uber anyway
what about low income adults pass and regular pass are they up for sale
the driver of bus 8012 just passed stop 8711 where there was a person waiting despite the fact that the person was standing up and was clearly visible from the road
hi i want to know if the student pass still available now for the train
the college one
i 2019ve been waiting for the bus 5 minutes before its schedule and when i looked in the app again the schedule was changed it left 10 minutes early don 2019t they have to follow the schedule i 2019m sory to say this but calgary transit has wasted a lot of my time
i was at the stop around 2 30 waiting for the 2 38 one but when i checked again it said the bus already left at 2 29
here 2019s another problem i couldn 2019t check where the bus was on the gps because the schedule can change but the gps doesn 2019t seem to cooperate sometimes
the first time i checked was around 2 27 and it said the bus would be there in 7 minutes so i went to the stop then time passed and it hadn 2019t come so i checked again at 2 37
no i decided to take the train instead
wtf i m currently in a train car where 43 other people are on driver kept letting people on wth
this is crap having to miss my train because i can t enter station amp run all the way to the other end of the platform
hi is there a way i can check departures of buses early this afternoon i just want to verify something thank you
hi sorry it was the 406 bus from seton to somerset bridlewood station supposed to be there at 12 23 pm stop is at wb seton dr main st se
now that drivers are asking for tickets again on shuttle buses are we supposed to deposit ticket on big buses and how do transfers work if i don 2019t have a ripped ticket
how do transfers work when i board a shuttle and deposit my ticket
are you able to verify if it did depart on time this afternoon at 12 23 or was there a significant delay
but my shuttle driver asked me to deposit my already ripped ticket in the box i have nothing to show on my next connection if prompted
the shelter and bench at stop 9267 could use a good power washing
let me be clear i am paying and want to pay i 2019ve been ripping and tossing tickets as needed i just don 2019t get how it works when some drivers collect the paper but don 2019t have a transfer to offer in exchange
yeah i dunno what this is but a power wash ought to take care of it
did it reach somerset on its scheduled time as well thank you i just need the info for a family member
twice now most recent was 15 this evening i 2019m not transferring this time but i have a medical appointment this week that will require 1 2 transfers each way so i want to know what to expect
is the google maps app accurate if it said it departed on time
thanks and to be clear not complaining about the driver just confused as to the current process
i see thanks and there is also no logs or timestamps of actual arrival and departures of buses that i can get the info i need
thanks i will
i have an appointment for my dog 2019s check up tomorrow and im just wondering if small dogs are still allowed in the train and bus

hi with the new changes happening lately is transit still going to be the same as in boarding via the back honor system for fares is there a set 201cend date 201d currently
there are sparks coming from a broken light at the off ramp 16 ave ne stoney trail ne
six weeks after locking down shelters at l stations you put up signs telling customers what you 2019re doing now if only you opened them back up at or near the posted time
ty
maybe instead of punishing paying customers they should tackle the real problem why treat riders that travel between 6pm and 6am as second class customers
how do passengers show the bus driver their bus pass or put a bus ticket into a box as payment for the ride if passengers are boarding the bus from the backdoor and not supposed to walk up to the driver
thank you
thank you

the calgary transit ststem is horrible even when times are slow they can 2019t get it right

ok thanks alot i ve been looking for one for a while now d83e dd14 d83d de32 d83d de00
so if there s limited time at chinook does that mean the platform will be closed
i don 2019t like to rat anyone out but the driver of the route 13 using bus 7940 has no idea where they are going
ok and will that be all the shelters thats at the bud loops
there is a detour on 8 street sw where there is a water main break south of 17th ave and myself and another passenger had to direct the driver through the detour and then back on the main route to 14 street
it 2019s not a big deal i know these are trying times for everyone but a little better route preparation for your drivers would be good i expected that from a weekend shuttle driver not a weekday newflyer driver
i don 2019t want to get anyone in trouble some better route planning would be good
ok thank you

you may notice something different when you see vehicles driving by this week these thank you ribbons were donated by calgary businesses to let front line and essential service workers know we see them need them and are grateful

i have a march low income pass can i use that for rides
you may notice something different when you see vehicles driving by this week these thank you ribbons were d 2026
thx
i feel like a raise or hazard pay would mean a lot more to the workers than a ribbon but to be fair idk if they gettin hazard pay
very sad to hear about layoffs at this time but we heard calgary 2019s mayor say 201cridership was down 90 201d yet services were only cut by 15 it 2019s no wonder calgary is having such financial hardship during these very difficult times
please ensure bus drivers are told to open back doors and not expect passengers to do so it s too hard for those with mobility issues as backdoors won t stay open unless drivers do so
you may notice something different when you see vehicles driving by this week these thank you ribbons were d 2026
it s happened a few times on different routes one on 126 this morning door closed on my bruised elbow don t remember time or coach number wasn t first time though
we want to thank all frontline workers amp essential service staff you 2019re doing an incredible job we will be showcasing 2026
on many occasions i have had to asked drivers to open the doors during these covid 19 times so i don t have to touch the bars or strips they are able to open them when entering the bus it should be easy to do the same when a person is exiting
actually lots of drivers will not open the front door regardless of a passenger needing it or not
you may notice something different when you see vehicles driving by this week these thank you ribbons were d 2026

my son was waiting for the 408 at brentwood station turned his head for a moment and the bus left without even stopping for more than 30 seconds i know there are very few riders but now he had to wait because the driver could barely come to a stop before leaving
are we still using the march bus passes for this month
mind telling me why the bus was over 5 mins early to my stop forcing me to watch it drive past without anyway to catch it the app even stated it wasn t supposed to be there for 3 more minutes please hold your driver s accountable madigan and minora dr ne
i hope you plan to rehire the drivers you 2019ll be laying off once the city is completely back to work i 2019m starting back in june and now i have to worry about how i 2019m going to get there
i bet at night you dream of kenney tea bagging you
guess why your not making any money as the bus drivers aren t asking for you pass or fees so most are riding for free
a big yeehaw to every city worker every driver every doctor nurse first responder and on and on for keeping this city rocking i stay home because i want every one of them to reunite with their loved ones soon

we want to thank all frontline workers amp essential service staff you 2019re doing an incredible job we will be showcasing 2026
when will routes be returning to regular schedules it s making early morning trips as an essential worker very difficult and adding so much extra time to the trips
the is set to lay off 400 500 staff that 2019s where maybe the money will come from
just as more retail amp service sector employees return to their jobs via you guessed it transit along with us essentials not everybody has a vehicle or drives everyone deserves a safe distant ride to work and home bring back those transit employees
unfortunately with the latest news of them cutting 17 000 hours starting may 25th it s not going to be any easier for quite some time
and to think i ve already had to double my use of uber to account for the changes awwwesome

ok thanks
with all the upcoming cuts when will we see revised schedules and what was cut
thank you to all the workers that continue to show up to help calgarians get to and from work groceries etc during this difficult time 2764 fe0f d83d de4f

are there defibrillators on trains or at train stations a 911 operator asked me to look for one at shag point and i couldn t find one thanks
your cleaners are asleep in a running vehicle in violation of the city 2019s anti idling policy
is the 43 running today was out there 5 22 am in the rain and it didn t show at stop 4557 38 came at 5 37 am
kudos to your excellent train driver going into town from 45 street station 2452 he is a rock star thank you d83d de03 d83d de03
no i took the 38 but the other person waiting left i noticed the schedule changed from 5 31 to 5 29 recently but wondered with layoffs coming if it had been reduced
just announced masks are mandatory on transit i don t think this is true
when where can i find out what routes will be affected by the cuts announced yesterday to be effective may 25th
just another example of the shoddy calgary transit system a strain on the tax payer and a failure as a service the only people that win as a result of this cluster fuk is the union
hopefully does the same drivers are essential workers who need hours to survive especially when they only gat paid a bit over minimum wage
meanwhile crickets from abgov about supporting and with ramping back up for reopening
too many methadditcs at chinook station you can 2019t even wait in the enclosed bus stops please have this addressed
some left 5 mins ago some still here
last two enclosed structures on the train platform in the south direction it 2019s hard to miss and they have littered everywhere inside the structure they are the only ones currently in the enclosure
on a consistent basis by my experience
the march pass will still be available until the end of may like before
i need to reapply for my low income pass but i don t have a printer and with the libraries closed i can t do it there if i was to go in to the fair entry application office in city hall could i show my notice of assessment on my phone or email it to print
agreed
just the low income i have the normal one
201c methadditcs 201d

will there be an extension on university u passes
is there now an online application option i thought the office was closed
yes
is the something going on that s new bus driver was just so rude kicking people off buses with out fare people had money ready but he said i cant take money than threw a hole bunch of people off
his conduct was defeneitly not becoming of a public servant the lady next to me gave me her phone number in case you would like to call her the asian drivers use of profanity was not called for i also like to say that those patterns did nothing to be provoked of it
i ve seen transit riders pick up since last week the buses and also c trains are more packed now then i have seen in the last 2 months
eb new brighton gate 52nd st se bus stop the garbage can is overflowing there are dog poop bags and garbage laying all over the sidewalk around it time to empty
i m not saying you should do this calgary transit but maybe tell drivers if people try to pay with money let the passengers get on for free on a case by case basis
now i m a big fan of amp you don t have to follow edmonton s lead but suggest to management maybe if people try to pay with money tell the drivers to waive the fare on a case by case basis yyc essentialworkers commonsense
bus stop 265 super gross definetly urine and questionable materials on the ground
now i m a big fan of amp you don t have to follow edmonton s lead but suggest to management maybe if people 2026
this should have happened two months ago when the distancing started not now when the restrictions are going to be lifted slowly
amazing i pay 111 for a bus pass and the last two months have been nothing but horrid experiences one after another between the homeless just polluting our transit bus drivers who clearly care less about their job than most and edmonton showing calgaru how it should be done
for those who don t have a car to drive getting groceries going to the covid 19 test sites going to see the doctor just got a lot harder due to all the cancelled routes it would be a good idea to reduce the service on all the routes slated for cancelation
so everyone can ride free then good to know always see the same ones riding free
i agree service should be reduced however i don t think it should be cancelled some folks don t have cars amp can t afford a taxi ride to the grocery store and to the covid 19 test sites how are they suppose to get where they need to go if the bus isn t running in there area
for those who don t have a car to drive getting groceries going to the covid 19 test sites going to see the doctor just 2026
what is the point of making people with low incomes buy a pass s when no bus is is able to take them to from the grocery store due to the route being canceled
note i do agree with service being reduced but i also know some communities don t have grocery stores in them that are affordable which causes people to travel outside of their so they can get their needs met i also know some folks can t drive or don t have a car to drive
first announces that low income folks have to buy the bus pass then they cut some routes that serve them it makes no sense to me don t they know people in poverty live in all city quadrants
what are you people thinking with plans in the books to reopen the city and get people back to work you cut routes and reduce services this will lead to overcrowded busses resulting in a greater risk of not allowing proper social distancing and in effect increasing the risks
you are taking a complaint because the driver wouldnt let them ride free so your siding with the free riding passengers during to taking a complaint against the driver so everyone can ride free
as you can clearly see he pays bills
i mean just going to throw it out there you could be greatful that you have a place to live and shelter rather than seeing them as methheads see them as a person the reason why the homeless population is so high in calgary is because people like you are too inconsiderate to help
sorry route 38 just south of the whitehorn l station south bound on 36 st ne
are bus passes still available to purchase i ve just realized i am probably returning to work next week and dont have one
terrible news more time wasted waiting for the bus and train
sorry i know it s rough for you all right now can i just get a confirmation on my tweet from earlier about what ctv said on tv this morning
my only issue is the use of the the f bomb in front of half the bus when no buddy provoked him or did anything other than get on the bus that s for your useless thoughts though have a great rest of day never with my time again though lol
as long as i can still ge to the liquor store i 2019m good
oh like that one time a crackhead threatened to kill me as i was waiting for the train at chinook lol
so sorry to hear that it 2019s really crazy now they had clothes dumped n the entire area and some other stuff dumped in the enclosure it 2019s getting out of hand 2639 fe0f
i need to catch the 3 by 9am going to heritage so should i just walk to victoria park for the c train given the above
he did not call the metheads he said addicts which is reality we can have compassion but this does not mean we have to watch it and be fearful from being at a station our stations should be a drug alcohol free zone where we feel safe
why are you scared of drug addicts such a stigma you should be happy you have a warm coat and shelter rather than having to hide in shelters overnight to try and survive we can have compassion so what kick them out of the only place they can possibly survive ahah what a joke
no joke you dont know my story i dont need to explain why i may be fearful you dont know or obviously care about what i have experienced i am grateful for my health and my life but i or others dont have to watch others doing drugs or consuming alcohol in public spaces
so with the city starting to open too soon you reduce service when more people will be using transit crowding the busses even further making it even more of a risk for your customers and drivers great thinking
i think we get the message now you can put it to rest
calgary transit is a joke kinda embarrassed on what you guys are doing
love the 1987 photo of sait station
any info about whether low march pass rolling into june
if the restaurants and stores are closed along the bus routes are closed where can the bus drivers wash their hands use the toilet the bus driver yesterday needed to go but could find an open washroom on route till he got to a gas station
these should be located at the bus terminals too train is often last not first stop on a multi leg trip
hey a guy on bus 5 8262 is about to smoke crack on the bus black hat bald sitting at the back of the bus also not social distancing from others
its 230 to 11pm and both times of day is fcuked up adds an extra hour in travel to the day when i say extra i mean it takes 40 mins both ways normally add 1 hour to that because its outside peak they re shift is 8am to 6pm if you work outside these hours d83d dd95
i 2019m on 12 2019s but only 14 shifts a month so we can bounce back with the days off but i feel ya
no lights tonight at whitehorn station
and mcknight
can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
why is the train scheduled to arrive at southland 6 47 not coming
it came on time just the schedule was skipping over it
car 2435 on the red line is making disturbing rattles and clunks and there s a panel hanging loose over door
hello we 2019re you aware that the signage on the bus shelter southland indicates it 2019s closed 6p 6a however it 2019s locked right now cheers
is the max orange bus scheduled to leave saddletowne station at 11 am today been stuck at station for 14 minutes will be late for work now
if you notice an influx of people in westbrook station it 2019s just all of us from westbrook mall staying warm while they deal with a fire alarm thanks for the warm place to wait
and not all communities have amenities that people can safely walk to ex their is no major grocery store in greenview inglewood both of which are part of the greenline
we are all back to work now thanks for keeping us warm d83d de42
where all the transit cops with all these fucking drug addicts getting on buses
hello calgary transit and everyone
i am doing good how are you
not good news for downtown recovery or 2066 2066 calgarytransit 2069 need to rethink how calgary will grow in the future definitely won 2019t be like we thought when mdp was developed yyccc 2066 jeromyyyc 2069 2066 councillorkeats 2069 2066 nenshi 2069 2066
hey i haven 2019t been on transit in a few months and didn 2019t realize there aren 2019t any transfers for the buses i asked for 2 transfers and he waited until i put the change in to tell me this
oh okay thank you
they left chinook going downtown like five minutes ago this is so typical and just heartless i want to cry
or perhaps revisit transit as just a way of getting to the office mostly the current model and instead of looking it as a way of getting around
another swift and efficient move by calgary transit 2 months to late folks
hey calgary transit you might want to get maintenance to check train car 2306 there is something horribly wrong with the joint on this car every time is rounds a bend there is a very large grinding noise coming from the floor and it 2019s also bouncing like crazy

excellent thank you

how come the transit cops are asking for tickets at 7th st on the train heading to 69th st sw that s still the free fare zone i understand asking at downtown west kirby but 7th st is free fare and people shouldn t be getting bugged for fare proof there
well my hubby refuses to show till west kirby and tells them to feel free to ask at that stop it s free fare zone and nobody should be bugged for fare where fare is not necessary
not good news for downtown recovery or 2066 2066 calgarytransit 2069 need to rethink how calgary will grow in the future definit 2026
there s a real chance here to turn downtown into a thriving mixed use community so it s alive and buzzing at all times of day
would have made sense to do this earlier are we not getting ready to open the city back up if it doesn 2019t happen soon calgary 2019s done

that s too bus 244 for running me completely off the road just now reporting to police and 311 as we speak cityofcalgary the joys of yycbike
yes for sure about 20 minutes ago in between 9th ave and 8th on 4th street driver saw me decided to pull over anyhow and force me into the curb
not good news for downtown recovery or 2066 2066 calgarytransit 2069 need to rethink how calgary will grow in the future definit 2026
please pull the footage from the bus and use it to educate your driver s on what not to do i abife by the rules of the road he completely forced me into the curb had all the time in the world to go behind me or do around this will involve charges as this is not ok
call calgary transit also hope you re alright
report submitted he did not hit me just completely forced me off the road into the curb worst part is he saw me completely
not good news for downtown recovery or 2066 2066 calgarytransit 2069 need to rethink how calgary will grow in the future definit 2026
back when i was still commuting to from work a bus would turn in front of me almost every single day on 9th ave and 6th st se heading west i ve been honked at by busses for being on the road i guess more times than i can count over by stampede sorry this happened to you
wouldnt you need a bus or rt any bus could be driving there
you mean this
that s a key
i was not injured only contact was me banging on the side of the bus as he forced me out of my lane into the curb
i moved recently and i want to purchase my june low income bus pass but it will go to my previous address how do i change my address

people of palliser the 125 is cancelled as well maybe don 2019t plan to use that one as suggests neighborhoodclusterfck also to get to the 2 x 2019s in red the 99 was suggested someone is looking at an old and better 79 80 map
how can you put your drivers in a situation where they can t even apply for covid relief you are putting these people in a hardship and making it so they can t feed their families please help the transit drivers
they have put the drivers that have gone to work every day in a 3 day work week so they are now getting 20 hours and will not qualify for any covid19 relief
at least the mayor of edmonton stepped up to support these essential workers so they can get help to feed their families and pay their bills how disgraceful
best 2020 work at home make up to 100 per tweet
with charging a flat fee per ride not regional it s the total volume that matters in preparing a biz case the fewer riders the greater the city needs to subsidize why downtown matters if biz case was based upon a certain volume going there
just want to point out it 2019s pretty inconvenient when you keep reducing times and services yet the province announced stuff is gradually opening so morons are out here crowding trains and buses causing us to wait for different trains or buses that aren 2019t packed
wish you cared about the employees that drive those buses everyday the way you seem to care about social distancing at a park
79 80 were so much better calgary transit planners forced the 99 and 95 upon the community regardless of the overwhelming negative feedback
have some graffiti here at the bus gate that separates diamond cove and bow bottom
hi there at kirby going to westbrook and no trains have come only two headed in the opposite direction do you know when next train is coming thank you 263a fe0f
this is counter to social distancing and with businesses slowly starting up
i used to be able to get places on the 79 80 now we can 2019t get to glenmore landing southcenter or trico center without the pain of bus transfers uber has replaced it for me for the most part for close community travel 2639 fe0f
they 2019ll adapt as needed but ridership is way down as is so in most cases social distancing can still be observed it 2019s costing the city a crazy amount to keep routes running that have very few riders as demand picks up i 2019m sure they 2019ll be able to start increasing routes
how can you put your drivers in a situation where they can t even apply for covid relief you are putting 2026
yay finally people in my building can go to a grocery store without having to transfer buses all they got to do is ride 101 inglewood
you have people doing drugs upper track level westbound to 69th st
native 3 of them 1 female 2 guys don t you have cameras the top of westbound side just before going out to the track
we should never again design platforms where the only wheelchair accessiblity is unreliable elevators even a mile long ramp is a better back up plan than nothing
woman smoking inside the train got off at 4 street station northbound red line first car just right behind the driver
have you seen our ad on buses college education study career careeropportunities yyc downtown
i am so tired of missing buses due to locking our train station buildings makes grocery shopping even worse if i need to carry them home or wait extra long times and i m very worried about the further cutbacks they re making this month
good morning to you and everyone at transit and follow passengers have a wonderful day
the shelter at chinook l has only been unlocked one day since this report i haven 2019t reported it till now because there 2019s no wifi at the station although it 2019s not 20 when i get there in the morning 8 20 quite often it 2019s been cool rainy windy
route 1 bus 6046 9th ave se bus terminal 10 40am operator refused to open back doors to let us off
if you are not a 9 5 customer you are a second class citizen and your needs don 2019t matter this problem could be solved by deploying more security but they choose not to if crowds are the issue those stations should have rather same restrictions 24 7
i am so tired of missing buses due to locking our train station buildings makes grocery shopping even wors 2026
yes good news is future city planning is moving away from transit and towards ride sharing like uber maybe other than calgary the city transit planners are highlighting this need with their horrible decisions
what are we supposed to do with tickets again once you board the bus rip it correct
ok thanks first time on the bus in 6 weeks d83d de04
or perhaps revisit transit as just a way of getting to the 2026
is it true that march monthly pass is still valid for this month or is it only applicable for low income passes thanks

has the transit ever considered going back to dial a bus that they had many years ago more economical would reduce the empty buses driving around picks people up from their block near home and takes them to the train for destination and back
write to the provincial and federal s governments requesting more funding for transit services
hey how do i use my transit ticket on the bus if there is no place to deposit it
hey i 2019m a student of uofc with upass but i lost my student id just a few days into the lockdown ending of march so i 2019m not able to get a new card and transit sticker for now can i get to ride the buses until i can get my id and sticker back
thanks
2404 and all other car attached going to saddletowne busy for no social distance plz make the service more frequent
they have put the drivers that have gone to work every day in a 3 day work week so 2026
do you know if the route 32 sunridge is running late i m at the stop at eb 64th ave amp centre usually the bus woulda been here by now
it showed up at 710
may i ask why you are reducing services amid the inception of stage 1 return to work for many service and retailers most of whom would use transit
that 2019s great to hear they are being offered in those locations be nice to see it in more central parts of the city for convenience and saving tax 2019s it used to run in oakridge amp palliser area it 2019s sad to see so many empty buses on the roads
can collectors should be fined and charged
good morning couple questions 1 is transit free right now because someone i know said they took the bus had to get on using the rear doors and could not approach the driver at all 2 is the monthly pass deadline going to be extended into june
maybe should check into offering this value added service on some routes
i question why you would have express busses running during the shutdown 133 specifically and then may 25 when people are going back to work you chose to suspend the route that is completely backwards now is the time people will start back to work
your wrong to base on the past two months you should have known ridership would be down and now it s going to increase common sense should prevail here
what s going on at rundlehorn dr 52nd st wheres the 23

if i m boarding the bus through the back what do i do with my bus ticket
this is on 2264 currently at somerset bridlewood station
but you said the driver 2018refused 2019to let you 201cof 201d so which is it
your basing future ridership during a pandemic on current ridership amp making adjustments weeks later so when buses become overcrowded based on ridership after relaunch of stage 1 you ll take another few weeks to ramp up service placing riders nurse here at higher risk
ya thats cool can you do something about the bands of natives on the trains
can you remind me what times bikes are allowed on trains
thank you

hehe thanks i miss riding the train and getting pets from strangers hopefully soon

it happens on every train and lately every bus i m on in case your not understanding every
heya i relied on 2 technologies for bus times your app and teletext for the 167 both said arriving at 5 58 i left at 552 and had to run for it bus driver said his schedule is 5 52 so why cant i rely on the 2 technologies you provide for accurate times
its so darn frustrating the poor bus drivers have been given their schedules why cant u make them available to the app or teletext not hard why is your app always wrong
the trains are empty thanks to spendshi notley and turdeau

with the economy opening up why slash services now it wasn t done earlier but now common sense would say see what happens with ridership as things open less service and vehicles at 50 but more demand makes no sense whatsoever
how about parking all those empty buses huge buses with only one or two passengers is a disgrace
with the economy opening up why slash services now it wasn t done earlier but now common sense woul 2026
honestly not sure what calgary your living in but the buses and trains are mote full each day since monday started literally have to wait a couple buses or trains in order to safely get on one that isn 2019t packed it 2019s nice to say keep your distance but no one listens anymore
hi can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
good morning hope today for you all a day of smiles and maybe some giggles thank you for taking care of us d83d de0a

where can i purchase a bus ticket i don 2019t have a bus pass and i noticed the buses don 2019t take this is the first time i will be boarding a bus since march due to pandemic thank you
thank you very much have a lovely weekend
on the max orange bus heading towards brentwood and the bus driver keeps stopping without reason to make phone calls and bus is already behind schedule as it is
i cant seem to find a number on the bus would it be on the inside somewhere
question why so many staff or drivers don t wear ppe that s why has employees sick d83d de37 with covid 19 if calgary transit not force them to follow rules and avoiding to be infected police also the same not protection and not ppe rules beginning from home d83c dfe1
good evening ct how are you guys doing this evening
yes i have a question for you
i noticed that the real time gps feed has been going up and down today is there a reason why is it because of the schedule change starting may 25
oh okay i was assuming that it was done since saturday the real time gps feed didn t have any problems since saturday
is b 300 still running
airport
thanks
i d bet a lot that the people in charge of this account didn t use transit before the pandemic they won t be using it with you peasants now i m sure you have cars and use them
please contact to find out what took so long to protect the drivers up to monday they had zero protection and now your cutting their hours again 19 5 hours a week so they won t qualify for the emergency benefit and they won t be able to live but you hired new
is the next ride feature on the web site accurate to the disruption this weekend i didn t see a schedule in the service updates page sorry if i missed it
okay thank you
calgary transit has shut down all stations downtown may 16 19 and will be using shuttle buses without any enforced social distancing in place avoid downtown as much as possible this weekend if you can this was at 6 am covid19calgary
kudos to all your drivers i really appreciate the sacrifice they make to keep us moving sadly i won 2019t see them after the 25th as you 2019ve taken away my bus so i have to drive d83d de2a

sure looks like it
just missed one going to somerset and the next is in 30 minutes that 2019s not regular schedule
southland heading south
how can you monitor ridership when the bus no longer runs i take the 151 from copperfield to the core and back i can not take the bus now as the commute would double and connections are not reliable i will be driving now
thank you i just got on
long tired night for some reason needed to start doing litteral jackhammer work just before midnight last night that went on for hours there are thousands of ppl living within a 1 block radius i wish they would plan with humans in mind d83d de13
ty have a gooder d83e dd1c d83c dffb d83e dd1b d83c dffb

hi 10 sb crossing elbow river now has strong urine smell all over bus 8002
someone wrapped in a yellow and white quilt sleeping at the top of the ramp southbound side marlborough station white shoes can 2019t see anything else
o have reduced mobility in pme knee and double knrr replacements walk with a cane and unmanageable to use back door was denied access to front dpor on rte 87 eb at 36 st and 17 ave se just moments ago now waiting for next one
sorry to hear that knowing that this may be the case bus drivers should lower the buses automatically and then use their mirrors to know when to get the bus back up again to leave
long tired night and woke up to even more construction noises going to be a long tired day x_x
shattered glass at brentwood station yyc
she would not even let me in front door did not bother to even open the door indicated back door unacceptable next driver got off bus so i could get on and off previous driver needs to learn from that one
when i was on the train multiple times at different locations with different officers they were only asking people who appeared homeless that was just my experience
michaelle i could not even get her to open the door
would be good for you to put cta phone number and wheelchair accessible vehicle calgary phone number on the sign since they are more accessible than the alternates you guys are providing even with a ramp it still hard for some disabled folks to transfer between buses and trains
wheelchair accessible vehicle calgary wav calgary 403 974 1110 calgary transit access 403 537 7777
you guys have done a great job through this the peace officers have also done well the crap they put up with on a daily basis is a lot but the last couple have months must have been really difficult on them
since places like southcentre mall have starting their re opening process how long will the no building access continue for at stops like anderson when ridership will start to rise as businesses open
can and do bus drivers ask to see a pass or ticket during this time
then route 78 driver deserves a raise first one to ask since mid march and i take transit daily
on another note are low income passes on sale for june at transit office on 7th ave or at city hall tellers
i was waiting on the bus stop route 111 the driver didn t pick me up other side of no frills

my favourite pastime is reading old newspapers amp just read nov 2019 article on b vs l it s inspired to add electric b vs l as new panel to conference in june does any1 know how to contact authors
are you able to help josipa out
great idea for a panel
so much for southland shelter being open during the day 2014 sign says only locked from 6p 6a here it is 9 45a locked calgarytransitinfowrongagain
the speaker near door 3 on car 2402 is completely dead on the red line
thanx
i hope the schedules of the busses those that remain will reflect the possible delays for passengers getting from the level crossings 2014 or that all drivers will remember to be courteous and watch for customers
of course on shuttle cash tickets can still be paid provided we 2019re only taking that bus right

thanks for making bridgeland a slum druggies and screaming bums everywhere
hi there do you know when the next summerset train will be arriving at lions park station

i was wondering if transit is going to eventually make it mandatory for passengers to wear masks
just found this on the floor at brentwood station right beside the ticket machines and i didn t touch it
if you 2019re able to pay your property tax by the june 30 due date you are supporting calgarians through the pandemic by funding essential services like emergency services amp
operator of car 2330 blue line key 81 was extremely rude simply because i pushed the handicap button to open the door
i got a book of youth transit tickets before this pandemic started i still have most of the tickets left but i turned 18 in quarantine now i can 2019t use the rest of my tickets is there any way i could get a refund for the rest or at least trade them for adult

when folks return to work on the 25th amp buses become more crowded increasing the risk to us immunocompromised essentials will transit then increase routes frequencies or at the very least have drivers use only the double long coaches ive already passed up rides dt crowding
you walk into it sit down and push the pedal down
good morning transit how are you all doing hay coffee time yet
i am doing good trying to stay busy hay i have a question for you regarding low income pass still good to use reminder of may
thanks
having access to transit for low income families amp individuals is crucial it may be the only way many can get to work medical appts amp groceries during covid 19 edmonton could shut down public transit for the summer mayor says

having access to transit for low income families amp individuals is crucial it may be the only way many can get to work 2026
now would really be a great time to have contactless fare cards and no paper tickets what s the status on myfare
better to be safe than sorry what is our guideline re in yyc
i have called cta they emailed this to me on page 15 it states if a disabled person can t ride regular transit due to regular bus stops being too far from their place based on their mobility assessment they are eligible to ride on cta

it cost taxpayers more to operate cta rides than it does to operate calgary transit that is why i think transit routes should be reduced but not cancelled
calgary transit access budget operating cost per trip 37 00 per trip calgary transit budget operating cost per trip 4 10

hi it was northbound redline to tuscany he was still on the train as i got off at 4th streer
in the last few months there was rollover for the low income bus passes will that be happening again for june or will a june bus pass be needed
thanks for heads up
are we going back to the original seating capacity on our buses i just had a over capacity bus drive by me
i don t normally catch the buses that are affected but i know of at least 4 people including 2 support workers and 2 disabled people who normally ride 117 mackenzie town express to work at superstore they are now riding cta everyday to get to and from their destination
bus 43 i 2019m not sure how many but enough to where people were sitting side by side and standing in the middle and back entrance
because cta only allows up to 2 people in their vehicles due to covid 19 4 vehicles are used in total to transport the workers and their clients to and from their destination
how do we pay our fares on the buses
where do we get the tickets and are bus pssses still in effect
oh okay thank you
would recommend your plan a trip service on your website not include cancelled routes temporary or otherwise i can t exactly take the 117 from mckenzie towne right now as much as i d like to and hope to do so again soon d83d de0f
hi the driver of the bus 23 didn 2019t stop and ignored me at bus stop 9477 at 5 50 pm today may 20 2020 i have been waiting for 30 minutes and the driver didn 2019t stop what 2019s wrong with it
when will buses start taking cash payments again
no problem was just trying to plan for going back to work
heard from a friend today that we re allowed to use march amp april bus passes for may is that true

just in time for the opening up of the economy should be fun
are low income march passes valid through june as they were for april and may or will we need to purchase june passes online
luckily my current fear of infection on public transit has coincided with having nowhere to go
just curious given reduced ridership why not run 1 or 2 train cars instead of 3 mostly empty even with riders distanced would not running the empty carriage be more economical
i 2019m legit scared some people on transit are not respecting social distancing which makes me wonder in these uncertain times is it okay to drop kick people who refuse to keep a distance of 2m
well credit where credit is due i know they do respond a few months ago transit peace officers were able to bounce a couple of really intoxicated and rowdy passengers from the c train when it pulled into city hall station
okay thanks

i tried to buy the june low income bus pass online but i don t have a credit card i was disappointed to find out my debit card isn t acceptable to use on the city website only a few debit cards are rbc christian union and first nations bank

serious question here unusual i know but when is the next service change scheduled for asking because lots of people are being recalled to work and i suspect crowed buses won t be the bast place not to spread coronavirus

bus rte 93 bus 7766 from 45 st lrt to richmond and stewart driver constantly and i mean constantly talking to passenger looking in mirror at her instead of concentrating on driving very unprofessional let alone unsafe driving

best driver i have had since mar 15 thank you bus 6056 mp he is very informative hilarious and super friendly can t get better than him 2764 2764 2764
as a result of covid 19 there will be additional service reductions starting on may 25 you can find the details here
first time catching this bus it was downtown beside the scotiabank i want to say 1 25 ish
are we supposed to be getting on the bus through the front again
ok the bus i got onto the driver had us go through the front so i wasn t sure if thats what we were supposed to do now
he wanted us to show our passes or tickets im on the 23 at bus stop 8280 i got on at 220 pm
for sure it was just odd for him to have us go in though the front thought maybe the policy changed
does the regular monthly april bus pass still valid today
just witnessed 2 buses almost break the crossing bars at chinook station heading east bus 8312 and bus 8313
your 145 bus driver locked us out of the bus and left at saddle towne stn and it s pouring rain
amazing service during covid in the rain
i ve been at the stop at saddletown station since 4 50 he s left the bus locked and there s a group of people soaked out here because there aren t enough shelters
bus number 8244
he literally locked himself out of the bus and left
it 2019s because people like to ruin it and steal operators shit
pretty sure it s against policy regardless and a huge dick move when it s raining to disappear for 20 minutes
the 5 03 did not show up by the way
y 2019all bitch about customer service and operators not being friendly than do this you 2019re exactly what 2019s wrong with the system get a fucking life bud
they 2019re allowed to secure the bus when leaving it unattended
hey your machines don 2019t really work in the rain hope i don 2019t get caught riding without paying d83d de0a
first time i have come across it in a long time and again a huge dick move when it s pouring rain now the bus is too full for people to sit spaced apart d83d dc4c
these reductions are exciting and positive news for the communities impacted by the noise and air pollution from large empty buses even pre covid oakridge route99 route95 transitplanningaccountability
reminder to all low income users of you need to buy your monthly pass for june asap especially now when avoiding the usual queue is crucial because of covid19ab buy online if you are able

that was my thought no way it works survive a fall
and now that we are preparing to reopen will the routes be re added and times adjusted so people will be able to get to and from work or are we just screwed because the union is in charge
i m a fan of the work spiders do but not usually a fan of ones in close vicinity but i feel like if i saw this guy i would be ok once they reach a certain size fuzziness my brain doesn t recognize them as a spider
i like spiders i also like spiders at a distance

yes and if they would accept concessions on contracts and possibly a lower wage that would help too charging the 100k people that use calgary transit 105 a month for sub par service is extortion i used to pay 35 student and 65 adult for 10 times the service
i 2019ve retweeted a lot of lost pets over the years but i do believe this is my first spider
any ideas when we can hop on the bus through the front door i kinda miss saying morning or hi to my drivers when i get on
only way calgary tooterville trolley will be 100 wind powered 2026
where can i buy low income monthly pass for june 2020
there is closer to 300k trips per day when things were normal and no the city can find other means to cut like our useless public art projects and million consultants for pathways and horticultural services their contract already got gutted so the city can do something else
we really miss using public transit but it s a decision we ve made as part of the health vulnerable of the city as a result we won t be going downtown or supporting the businesses we used to access using the c train darn covid d83d de20
wednesday will be my first day back taking transit and i will be wearing a mask let 2019s come together and keep everyone safe d83d de37 a big thank you to all transit workers for continuing to show up to work and keep our city moving d83d de4f
awesome d83d de10
i haven t been on transit for a while now due to covid 19 do peace officers wear a mask it would be good if they did then riders can see them as a good example
wait was there an option not to d83e dd26 200d 2640 fe0f
i 2019ve retweeted a lot of lost pets over the years but i do believe this is my first spider
i stopped buying my pass because i stopped taking the bus except on the rare occasion social distancing is nearly impossible because people refuse to respect the signs on the seats and refuse to move out if the door way too transit is my very last resort
this is awful and i won 2019t say i 2019ve been thinking about it all day but please find it climbs back into hazmat suit

oh god oh god
so happy for them rocks back and forth
how long are the shipping times roughly i bought mine 5 days ago so im just wondering when to expect it

help this tarantula make her way home
like this
animal services isn t open yet but could you maybe send a couple transit officers to city hall station outside the school i think one of the resident geese was hit by a car in the crosswalk it s limping pretty bad
aww poor goose baby
is there a somerset l bound 153 bus on its way to stop 9616 i 2019ve been waiting 15 minutes and expected there would be one here about 7 20
i was going to use the link to complete the survey was rewarded with a red bannered page saying access denied and that folks says it all
i 2019ve just been told by your csr that despite the schedule saying it would be here at 7 22 the time was actually 7 14 so even though i was here 13 minutes before it was actually 2018due 2019 i missed it and the mayor wonders why more people don 2019t use transit
the 7 48 bus is here at 7 44
please change the online schedule then
hey i haven 2019t been taking the bus to work this thursday will be my first time in months how can i buy single use tickets my bus is about 6 stops away from the nearest train station so i won 2019t be able to use the ticket machines
as everyone has to use the back door to enter and exit is there a way that drivers can lower the back door so those of us who are not young and limber but do not have walking aids can manage better or have drivers pull their back door closer to the curb
how will safety be handled at rundle marlborough and whitehorn ctrain stations there have been alot of drug and safety issues lately as well and alot jump between stations or go somewhere then return after peace officers remove them
like ridiculous lie about being entirely powered by wind d83d dc81 200d 2640 fe0f maybe she 2026
wow be safe
or your dogs just saying d83d de1c
you can also buy books of tickets 7 11 2019s circlek 2019s usually

it s too bad that the drivers were not given plexiglass barricades to protect them from the public ask any nurse or doctor how awesome it feels to wear a mask at work all day
i can understand i ve tried over the past few times i m out but they re just too uncomfortable to wear
a reminder that service changes have started visit to plan your route
it s been going on continuously for over a year problem far from solved
also the effectiveness of a cloth mask really isn t known and would vary quite a bit anyways based on the quality of materials used

calgary transit doesn 2019t run on 100 renewable energy the c train is just a portion of the cts it 2019s huge fleet of buses are not electric diesel mostly
who cares if calgary transit powered by wind it is surviving as we all doing
when will the myfare app be launched
the wind does not replace the oil d83e dd1d quite opposite to what all climate change champions declare thanks for info d83e dd70
absolutely not it is about choice not to ease the fears of those around you thy chose to live in fear
absolutely not it is about human rights and choice no one should feel obligated to wear a mask to ease the 2018fears 2019 of others they chose to live in fear if one is really sick perhaps they shouldn 2019t be out or do wear a mask but leave those alone who choose not to
you can be sick and not know it it 2019s called being asymptomatic wear one or don 2019t but at least be informed in your decision and your outrage
wrong choice of gif come on that s closer to a burqa than a mask
its not it 2019s
i wear on the bus and at grocery stores i want to be careful and safe for me
what time is the next train coming at brentwood station heading towards tuscany
so it it by the honour system if people have paid for their fares as i seemed to be the only one showing my transit pass when getting on the bus
masks protect others from you not the other way around
masks can be uncomfortable cloth mask effectiveness isn t known and likely pretty poor at best and those with asthma or other issues may have issues with them
i don t
holy moly pushing this a little much don t ya think
yes one showed up eventually was late for work as i rely on the first bus of the day to make it there
any updates on the digital payment option
can you confirm what the plans are for increasing the train frequency on the red and blue lines i e getting back to the pre covid schedule yyc
nope that is access denied too are you sure you want feedback
fair this just seemed like a good time to rush it forward especially with the new shields going up that seem to mostly block the fare box so it had my curious
keep drinking the koolaid anyone wearing a facemask should stay home and home isolate so the healthy people can go about their business covidbullshit
koolaid propaganda the ccp must be proud of these lemmings
you focus on the cesspool of germs on the surfaces of your c trains and we ll focus on us
sorry but this video seems a little inappropriate almost feels like i 2019m about to get chloroformed and mugged d83d de33
just took transit access to the alex got the mask on
i 2019m going to ride naked
my folks are seniors and my other family members are health care workers i wear my mask for all of them i don t want them to get sick
some of us have cops and have troubles breathing with masks on but still need to get out and get grocery 2019s and such
where when can i get my life income bus pass
psa
with exception for asthmatics and people with autism most of the general public can get a mask and wear it even if they have little to no income thanks to the fact they paid their taxes to the alberta government noexcuses stopcovid19
39th ave station every shelter on the station full of homeless people carts bags and one just broke a bunch of glass in a bag trying to ride on the southbound side platform got caught in his wheel broke glass then tore open bag so shattered glass here
link doesn t even work it this is what it tells me

okay the offices are open good d83d de42
ok i will try again thursday
bunch of people camping out smoking and taking over the shelters at the chinook train platform
saw them thank you
sorry but this is not necessary especially since cloth masks do not protect at all they re great for trapping germs most people don t wear masks correctly and touch their faces more and so many people litter
201cbased on what we now know about the dynamics of transmission and the pathophysiology of covid 19 the negative effects of wearing masks outweigh the positive 201d dr antonio lazzarino of the department of epidemiology and public health at university college london 1 2
rather than sending by law why not send social workers
for this virus to be so contagious the main route of transmission must be via the smaller invisible particles which are not filtered by surgical masks or scarves or bandanas therefore trying to block the bigger particles gives a minor protection against the transmission 2 2
all the mask does for me is make it so i cant breath most dont perverted you from getting the virus maybe start kicking the crack heads off the trains other then worry about who has a mask on
if that is true i think you should just stay home at all times
yeah roughly 100 calgarians would still be alive if anyone really cared many preventable deaths if properly designed for safety not speed also a current issue developing
seriously people really have some respect for others don t make extra work for the people whi have to clean all the transit buses night put your fucking garbage where it belongs its not rocket science people
kinda hard for healthcare workers to stay at home we wear masks why it reduces the transmission of infection btwn ppl we dont let vanity amp ego get in the way of common sense unlike those refusing to wear masks we engage in analytical cognitive behaviour to keep ppl safe
wrong masks do decrease the chance of shared vontagion and infections you dont think surgeons wear them as a fashion statement do you d83d de44
please keep an eye out for this missing tarantula
they do not wear cloth masks they wear medical grade masks that have filters surgeons wear masks to protect the patient from their germs entering the patient learn to read before you comment
a lesson in history we started wearing cotton masks in the or and on tb units a hundred years ago cause guess what they discovered it helped reduce the mode of transmission of contagion and infections good lawwrd broaden your scope of knowledge
no thanks suck it
wondering if unused transit passes from a book of 10 purchased in 2019 can still be used
the body is smart it notifies you when you have a virus trying to rid it your body will show symptoms somehow i think the asymptomatic business is additional propaganda to keep us all in funny how people roam around when they have a cold go to work school etc
yes they are as i got my bus pass last week
kill it i would run away is it found yycspider
don 2019t think i 2019ll let terry drive my bentley again wwe pr 2026
you are insane
it should be mandatory to wear a mask while shopping
wearing this face mask every person will look like terrorist lol
i m a lifelong 50 year old transit user i had my contract expire last month so i only take transit 3 times a month or so 109 for 3 trips is excessive i go for groceries that s it it s a small trip down the hill 5 minutes or so
transit app is active i just checked it again this is my first pandemic you have better ideas for ticketing people in a pandemic
what are you doing to make it easier to buy fares
i ve been aware of 10 pack tickets for decades this is my first pandemic any advice for a global pandemic
just saw a man passed out on the bench on the lower level inside franklin station as i was running to catch my train please send assistance for him thanks amp have a great day d83d de0a
awesome thanks
it appears someone set a fire of sorts at the tuscany station 2019s waiting area by the bus loop there 2019s ash everywhere and the glass is burnt
hi there one side of the glass at stop 6755 is broken
a reminder that service changes have started visit to plan your route 2026
do passengers who are able still have to get on using the rear doors of the buses
i can buy my low income bus pass today
so hard to read the comments of people here man
are we still using cotton masks no we aren t they are not effective if you care for a tb patient they are on airborne precautions meaning full ppe with and n95 mask that has to fit tested to your face you yet no protection against the virus with a cloth mask
this virus is airborne as argued at 80 90 filtration of aerosols by hybrid cloth mask all masks can filter airborne to some extent more mask studies info filtration rates comparisons
is there any saddletown train coming
i forgot to thank you it only took six years of me trying but you guys finally announce which train is pulling in as it 2019s pulling in i 2019m so excited for this especially downtown now my blind ass probably won 2019t be getting on the wrong train
good morning transit the seat close to door 13 needs little cleaning
good morning transit first car redline 2242 about to leave tuscany station close to door 13
it s becoming quite a fashion item get jean paul gautier to make some and madonna will be his model
for those with compromised immune systems like myself
train 2402 has no working fans or ventilation very unhealthy leaving sunnyside going south
i don t
question can the low income pass be delivered
it was so nice to see heritage station free of people loitering at 6 in the morning
thanks
the driver of the 7 i got on made me and another passenger get on the front of the bus we were both waiting for the back doors to open they didn 2019t so approached the drivers door to ask them to open it 1 2
congrats it only took a few years but you finally moved rt 150 to the right stop no more being told by drivers at both stops that i was at the wrong one maybe some cement pads in another 2 3 years so we dont have to wade thru ankle deep mud when it rains
i caught the bus at the corner of 14th st and 17th ave it was around 3 30 i 2019m not sure about the exact time the clock was not flashing on the bus
uhm towards south calgary not downtown i don 2019t know n s
i wear it to feel safe and protect others around me
again the little things i understand the need for covid19 precautions but i would like to point out when you are in a wheelchair the back door entry to calgary transit is not accessible everyone stayhealthy yyc
this makes look peachy d83d de02
for the transit employees keeping us safe and employed
i wear a mask because i want to stop the spread as well i want every doctor nurse grocery store worker transit operator etc get back to their home safe and can have family time as i do they deserve all of us do deserve
are they still available from shoppers macs etc
this is a great idea it would be nice to see some history incorporated in station designs from art to stations themselves
thank you we should be incorporating history where we can into this project and in intend on expanding on the relevance opportunity in a written piece one great example i ve seen recently is with the st george s island bridge project
thank you we should be incorporating history where we can into this project and i intend on expanding on the relevance opportunity in a written piece one great and recent example comes to mind for the st george s island bridge project
why do we need to give single ride ticket if the drivers wouldn 2019t give transfer pass so if we need to ride more than 1 bus we need to give 2 tickets which will cost 7
and it is not ideal for people who works only few hrs a week to buy a monthly pass either is it ok to just pay with coins
how will i validate if i don 2019t ride ctrain
ok i 2019ll see if other driver will accept that thanks
i wear mask most of time when i run errands outside just to keep myself safe and others around you it 2019s best and highly recommending to wear masks
where can i get my low income pass i can not get it online because i only have cash or is the march pass going to be good for june as well
good morning my friends how 2019s it going
i discovered when i have my mask on it helps me to social distance and to remember to use hand sanitizer
oh yes great weather i am heading out of town with a friend today i certainly will have a great day and you has well have a great day
we are in the same household
morning why is there so many empty buses moving along 24st se between 114 ave and deer foot trail this starts at 4am and continues all day if the cycle time for the run is every 30 mins then the drivers must be leaving each stop early route 92 96 150
would be nice if my bus drivers and the cleaning staff were wearing them wearing them properly
i was on the bus monday and i was the only one that showed my bus pass and everyone got on and off the bus without showing anything so how is this working by the honour system i bought a pass for june by why if none is showing payment
the westbound 153 bus reached stop 9616 at 7 43 today and i was told earlier this week that it was due at 7 50 please tell your drivers that being early may mean up to an additional 30 minute wait for passengers it has happened to me earlier this week
hopefully when the budget cuts happen social media staff and fake surveys will be the first thing to go
i wear a mask at work it keeps others safe slightly reduces my exposure and helps spread the message that we can beat this virus if we stay vigilant with our new routines sanitizing mask handling hand washing etc stay safe smart and strong yyc
i wear a mask as a sign of respect to those around me
there also nothing if they need to pay cash or need a transfer it 2019s looks like it free and i should do it because everyone else is i 2019m not but guessing people are thinking that i thanked my bus drivers some are nice and other grumpy i get it it 2019s strange times
enough we get it
i wear one when i go to the grocery store i 2019ll be taking for the first time in 10 week on monday and i 2019ll wear one then too even though as far as i know i 2019m not sick it protects front line workers who risk their health everyday
hey how can bus riders pay with tickets i 2019ve been trying to find information online but couldn 2019t find what i was looking for
studies are showing wearing masks are worse than not you tend to touch your face more no body wears them right and they don 2019t protect anything
unfortunately not everyone will be doing the honourable thing but thanks again for your quick response to my question
can riders rind the bell when their stop is approaching
agreed i have been able to reduce my use of ct a lot since the pandemic hit but the dozen or so times i have had to only one driver was wearing a mask and that was pre rear door boarding if ct is going to preach to us about it they should practice what they preach
so are you going to be providing us with masks then
one of the cleaners on the heritage platform was wearing a mask with his nose out of it d83e dd23
i wear a mask at work it keeps others safe slightly reduces my exposure and helps spread the message that w 2026
which way do we rip it and what do we say to peace officers who tell us it s not good enough

absolutely right should retire their old l cars with updated vehicles transit will be more appealing more people will take it better value for taxpayer dollars etc
ahh yes the study in 201cmodern incel 201d magazine that 2019s the one you mean right
times when a tap to pay system could have really helped you could even put them at the back doors
i ve rode ridden for most of my life and amp the rest of yyccc better believe i support the greenlineyyc as well as expansion to cycletrack and redefining how calgarians get around
i wonder if they 2019ve thought about this before d83e dd14
can i get my bus pass at leisure centrevillage square
i wear a mask as an act of citizenship it says 201ci want to do all i can to make you safe 201d
i wear a mask as an act of citizenship it says 201ci want to do all i can to make you safe 201d

well congrats finally had a peace officer get close enough to read the ticket i 2019ve been using since april 1st april fools
route 43 bus 8025 bus driver outright says he is not enforcing when too many people are on the bus but he offered for people to get off and catch the next bus if they are uncomfortable said it loudly and confused a lot of riders happened 19min ago
on barlow near small roundabout buss is currently on 36th st south of memorial
has this driver informed control of his overload situation
or pay on your phone why are we so far behind cost them for sure
i said 100 yrs ago do you have difficulty reading of course us healthcare workers wear medical grade masks on duty off duty we wear whatever mask bandana scarf you can find if you are not able to safe distance a cotton mask is better than no mask
the 129 sage hill set to leave at 5 25 has either left early or hasn 2019t shown up at all
i don t want to be the one who makes my friends my family and other people around me sick that is why i wear the mask every time i go out in public
nope and will provide them to all albertans
my point is that things have changed from 100 years ago they would have stayed the same if those masks were effective but they are not
can i see that study plz
i 2019m deliberately not taking transit
same it 2019s a last resort
thank goodness someone is taking responsibility heaven forbid calgary transit should take responsibility for anything
just curious if your 2 main locations dow town are open at all since i can 2019t buy my low monthly income bus pass online
can you get it at your 2 main locations downtown not sure if there open since i can 2019t get my low monthly income pass online
thanks
any way the 9 can wait a few minutes at mru south station i 2019m waiting for the 20 in marda loop and it is running late going to heritage adds 20 minuets on to my compute and takes me 20 blocks south of glenmore
well when your on a bus your not exactly performing a tracheostomy risk of a high viral load is unlikely unless your on 1 wearing a cotton mask will suffice in protection from asymptomatic carriers who get too close sneeze spit eat or have poor hygenic behaviour on board
ps your point was you stated masks arent necessary trap germs amp contribute to litter read your 1st post again wrong on all counts necessary distancing is not always attainable on a bus 2 hold germs no they minimize exposure to such 3 litter cotton washables aren t tossed
do we know if she was found
yes she was
maybe if you had shut it down when edmonton did you wouldn t be begging people to keep you in service you re low ridership was due to the pandemic ya got that right this is exactly why you re in this position now smh
what s going on with route 99 yesterday and today it was 10 min late i m at stop 4243
hey i m at bus stop 2488 why did the 99 bus stop here is there a detour
i wear the mask but if calgary transit is asking us to wear a mask i feel all calgary transit operators should follow the same advice i have seen maybe 2 drivers with mask 2019s
this is a disturbing gif can you please stop using it
i came here to say just this this spammy campaign is very hypocritical when i take the bus i wear a mask toprotect the driver and my fellow passengers to bad the drivers don 2019t reciprocate guess passengers really don 2019t matter

i ve rode ridden for most of my life and amp the rest of yyccc better believe i support 2026
wonderful
you tell us to wear masks but not your driver s
yes and i make sure to get to the stop early as the route runs every 45 min
like your customers had a choice
forasks to be effective they have to be changed often when damp condensation feel free to provide them foc if you believe what you 2019re saying next week it 2019ll be something new re masks
for masks to be effective they have to be changed often when damp condensation for example feel free to provide them foc if you believe what you 2019re saying next week it 2019ll be something new re masks
will low income bus passes from march still be used for june thank you
shocker
thanks i ll try again online my total cost was showing 0 00
light years behind edmonton transit for example accessibility was supposed to be part of l pedestrian crossing study headed by thompson with the intent to update never made it into study report thread

nobody is near the driver back slow loading for the time being you on the other hand are sitting in close proximity to other passengers this is what it is for

red line train to somerset can you have someone to check up on him
there is a guy sleeping on the train taking up the wholeeee bench car 2401 red line south bound leaving city hall the train is quite busy and this shouldn 2019t be tolerated anymore

he was on the 3rd car
has been totally free and will continue to be until june 15th they 2019re also letting users continue to use april passes in july if they had bought one i 2019m surprised hasn 2019t done the same
try 2 out of 31 people wearing masks the other morning on my train car amp i was 1 of the 2 you can not safely distance with 31 people on a car either
is that george floyd
no thank you i have not seen a single worker sanitizing the escalator handrails
why are you removing the 201cdo not sit here 201d stickers on the bus seats it 2019s hard to respect the 2 m distancing when more and more people are starting to use transit again and things are getting crowded if anything more signage is needed to enforce it not less
where the hell is your route 10 stop 7380 i 2019ve been waiting at the stop since 7 05 supposed to show up at 7 14 no show
dear thank you to the very nice bus driver who let me out the front door of the bus i had a huge load amp really needed the lower floor sadly because socialdistancing i didn t get her name
dear thank you to the very nice bus driver who let me out the front door of the bus i had a huge load amp r 2026
dear i totally understand amp respect your policy of rear door only because of covid19 but for a disabled person such as myself this presents real physical difficulties no i don t know what to do about it you have to protect your drivers amp the public both
route 31 caught at lion s park at about 7 23
i did not know that thank you for telling me i have arthritis amp was carrying a grocery buggy getting into the bus required some unusual athleticism on my part i think you should put some signs up to let people know
curious if the pathway that connects to chinook mall is opened
ty u2
there are signs about it on the bus window right by the front door if you are trying to board at the back it is easy to miss them though
there are signs about it on the bus window right by the front door if you are trying to board 2026
oops which is precisely what i did of course miss them i mean
is the red line running from sunnyside to chinook
ok thanks i was looking on the transit app and map app but they were showing i 2019d have to take a bus once i got to 6 st sw
i don t envy the weird backlash this post will get literally you re just asking people to pay their fare not steal
happy saturday to you all
how 2019s everyone doing today
we only got coins to pay to bus driver is that ok
we also need transfers from bus driver
do your ticket machines accept bills
meanwhile in edmonton transit is free for another few weeks
i believe in transit i believe in well built innovative transit that challenges the norm and continues to evolve right now is somewhere between a b to c grade new ideas and leveraging partnerships can see this grade improve greenlineyyc supports this
for those who can t get it online they can get it at the following places listed below please note village square and southland leisure centre are closed due to covid 19
the chinook heritage c train replacement bus i am on id 6008 may have actually been soiled with human faeces but the smell is bad enough that nobody seems to want to actively look for it someone has notified the driver but i think it needs to be inspected
will it be mandatory to wear a mask to ride on your buses and trains
ok wait so what if i had to transit to the other side of the city that required 3 different buses i 2019d have to pay 3x rather than once because you aren 2019t giving out transfers
why aren 2019t any trains going from southland to downtown they 2019re all heritage all day
i am really baffled as to why there has been almost zero posted guidance on ctrains or platforms on your covid 19 guidelines and recommendations really doesn 2019t make the trip feel safe at all
as someone with a disability who uses access to get around i can 2019t go get the mask through the drive through cta will not take me to it because i 2019m not staying at the restaurant i wish it was mailed to me

you guys are terrible this city in general does not care about social distancing l is down amp makes everyone take the bus you guys suck boycottyyctransit
you guys suck always repairing bc you don 2019t know how to do a job properly
we love a good no seat belt moment
your signs at city hall reversed the line colours
i am moving to calgary in july and i know you have a hiring freeze on right now would i be able to submit a resume and if so what email address thank you for your time
can you please give me the schedule of route 149 around 6 pm at heritage l i couldn 2019t find it in the app tnx
thank you for the reply i will keep my eye on that page
wow

tnx
hey the app seems to think the redline southbound from north end terminates at erlton is it confused or did something change earlier it was just heritage chinook that was out
thanks
and ya look cute might not be important to the cause but important nonetheless
hey is bus 4 gon na be at stop 8045 soon been waiting here for about 45 minutes now
ordered hubby 2019s pass on saturday last week got it yesterday super easy no lines yyc calgarytransit
it 2019s easy to do trying to get on with stuff is difficult at the best of times
it 2019s easy to do trying to get on with stuff is difficult at the best of times
so true
100 un organized having heritage doors closed so you have to walk from red line bus and have train leave as people are at the cross now waiting for a new train that is not here yet and making it so i miss my connection why do i pay for such poor service
can 2019t wait for transit passes to double in price once this is over
is there a way to back pay for the month of may i couldn t buy a bus pass nor bus tickets because a lot of things were closed and i feel terrible
grocery stores and convenience stores don t sell the low income bus pass for people on aish and people on ab works who don t get paid till june 1 the only way to get it is to buy ticket so you can buy the bus pass at the places listed on the website
hey guys what time are the trains running till now
is ctrain travel free at this time
i heard they all went up in price again is this true
complain to your mla because it 2019s totally legal d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f
any chance you could look into the 29 35e route schedules i literally have to walk half an hour to get to the nearest train station because otherwise it 2019s a 45 minute wait on weekends they both come within a minute of each other
755 lake bonavista dr se stops 6061 6058 i 2019m not sure when they arrived because i didn 2019t want to sit in the sun for 45 minutes but the 29 was scheduled for 6 44 and the 35 was scheduled for 6 43 it just makes getting to and from work incredibly difficult
are drivers going to actually start checking cause right now they just poo poo us and wave us away when we try to show them our pass or tickets
does the route 22 drive by the old alberta children s hospital that was located near richmond road
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc
oh gods that 2019s here how embarrassing
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc
appreciate some attention is being made however person on train saturday afternoon sprayed cloth once with whatever solution was in bottle amp proceeded to wipe all poles straps in entire car no added spray added at anytime similar to wiping every table with 1 dirty cloth
mean while in canada
best part is they got on at like city hall station with that thing they must have carried it from the river lol
every american city burning calgary 2 dudes fighting with an air mattress on a train lt 3
hahaha omg
was not intending to make an issue of it so do not have train car number i got on at 4th street station blue train going to 69th st approx 2 to 2 15 pm guy wore a florescent vest that said bee clean he was already on train car and he got off within next few stations
if it is any help the train was the second newest model not the red side seats but the gray ones the drivers door leads out to the door loading entry not the bench seats for 4
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc

i just saw the bus driver didn 2019t stop for a lady running for to the third to the last stop 402 silverado i am in the car but i check our stop it was supposed to be 8 55 for our stop because i take the bus too but my mom drove me and it was way too early
just a friendly reminder that pass extensions ends today may 31 d83d dc47
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc
evidently they have never had to move furniture don 2019t they realize that if they angle it it may get in the door

yess you have tik tok
the edibles have kicked in
this is too good
just a friendly reminder that pass extensions ends today may 31 d83d dc47
city of calgary vehicles are exempt from parking bylaws in practice it gets exercised uncritically here volume counts are performed via a vehicle occupant from sidewalk zoned for bikes peds why not arrange for a parking spot 3 metres away cc
ugh how annoying
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc
it 2019s definitely a problem in need of a solution instead we get knee jerk response
to further point out your wasteful spending on mass surveillance rather than service
practice what you preach until all your drivers are wearing masks don t tell us to wear them
oh straight people
god it 2019s not that difficult to chose the right gif for these kind of tweets
yes thank you someone else that sees my point the last one was actually creepy felt like i was about to get mugged d83e dd26 d83c dffb 200d 2640 fe0f just post a picture of someone wearing a mask it 2019s not that hard
lol
so theoretically someone in the wrong state of mind could catch it could someone in a somewhat right state of mind come close i 2019m confused
this is how most people transport their rafts d83d de2c
cos i look so fashionable
oh fucking grab a pair of ovaries
let me roll my eyes at how absurd you are
of course they likely don t care these are likely automated tweets as they haven t responded to a single one of them since starting the mask campaign last week
some of us have troubles breathing with mask because of copd but still need to be able to get out and get grocerys and such
why didn t they just let the air out first haha d83e dd26 yyc
bus 14 heading to shc there was no air circulation on i asked the driver to turn it on after a few minutes it was boiling i told him that s all he had he replied i be been taking this bus for years i know something is wrong could it be the heat is on
trash everywhere at trundle station
yea i can t see it now it s just pulling in to shc now
and many many thanks to the driver of route 8 bus 8209 for a morning of cheers as i ran my marathon in loops and crossed paths with him over and over again today it meant so much to me
it just left shc
south health campus 14 bus
i was running from 7am until just after noon so i was seeing the same set of drivers through the morning there were lots of safe waves and encouragement from rte 20 rte 31 rte 104 but especially rte 8
just those small gestures during a solo marathon makes an incredible difference
ticket machine 603 at sunnyside station isn t working the touchscreen is black and it won t come on

interesting response they probably should wear masks but why do you need to wait for them to do it first do you also loiter and say i will stop loitering when my neighbours stop
are rush hour bike rules still in effect during covid
i don 2019t even bother with anymore because they just tell me it 2019s my fault for using the app for being at the busy stop early but not early enough for running after the bus that was early we 2019re in the middle of a trying time but none of these issues are new
i wear a mask to protect the drivers and my fellow passengers when can i expect drivers to do the same funnily enough you post this often and never respond to this point about drivers
not an incident and not as dramatic as i make it out to be when i 2019m frustrated and getting soaked i was at a bus stop several minutes early and waiting when i saw the app counter flip from 6 to 4 to 3 to 0 the 42 and i 2019m in an uber now
thank you for bringing me from home to work everyday and keeping our transit system worry less to ride during the local state of emergency now another month is about to enter covid19 calgaryatitsbest essentialworkers
65 market mall stop at charleswood amp brentwood mall the app said 6 minutes
i know what the issue is the app doesn 2019t match the bus 2019s progress i know it can 2019t be perfect but it should be close when the only option is a bus that runs every 40 minutes in this case 42
calgary transit why do you promote the use of face masks if you not setting an example please
that means nothing i have seen one driver wearing a mask this whole time if you aren 2019t going to practice what you preach stop preaching the hypocrisy is unacceptable
the app is so buggy they have been using the same excuses since i worked out in heritage gate 2 years ago
this has been my experience for 22 years
i am officially back to work tomorrow i just realized i didn t buy a bus pass or tickets how do i pay in the morning
thanks i was going to run to shell but its raining so bad i ve bussed my whole life just wasn t sure if i was allowed to pay cash yet
no idea 65 market mall doesn 2019t follow a fixed schedule so i was just watching the app charles woodson brentwood stop sometime around 5 30
maybe not the day for this photo
you are welcome and everyone

plus when he came to my stop he made sure to slam me into the door partitions because i called him out
this was route 3 going through dt a little after 6 pm 6th ave and east of 2 st sw when i caught up to bus because he blew past two stops early attached pic is the stop where i got off he made sure to hit the breaks hard so i slammed into the door partitions
i have a real problem with the amount of transit drivers that blow through stops early so they can sit at a time stop and use their cell phones for personal use happens too often on my routes particularly 3 93 36 41 routes i use regularly
kinda hard to get to the fare box on the smaller busses 2014 design of the shield is flawed

hey i had a quick question about your 900 bus that takes you out to crossiron mills does it cost more money than a normal bus thanks in advance and have a good night
congrats heather well done
good morning my friends how are you all doing
is the 300 running on schedule is there a bus headed downtown at 8 from harvest hills
i am doing good
is that on the bow valley side or the city hall side
i went to the 711 near my house today and they let me know they still haven t received any is there a reason why physical copies aren t being delivered
good morning i 2019m going back to work june 15 can i buy my bus pass month of july can i used ticket at the bus for june
bow valley side
this morning i was early and no bus in sight even though i checked the app before to be sure its route 2 stop 4860 this is not unique to the stop though and this isn t just an inconvenience it s an accessibility issue
oh absolutely another beautiful day out
let these people know your concerns
i know it s of limited effectiveness in protecting me from the virus directly but i kind of hope the fact i m wearing one keeps the un masked a safe distance away by their thinking i m sick also it has bunnies on it
have you asked the provincial government if you could give them out do it publicly here now since people taking transit most likely do not have a car to get to drive through fast food joints for some earn your fares
might want to put up somewhere that you can t get low income bus passes at village square location
is this still happening
are your drivers wearing mask s
thank you
no and these are automated tweets so you won t likely get a response to this obvious question
kinda figured thanks
no problem they ve been tweeting about this for the past week and have been silent about it when called out by several people each time
2026
i wear a mask because i 2019m immune compromised wearing a mask helps keep me safe but also everyone else safe it might not be 100 but i 2019d rather wear a mask than a ventilator d83d de37 d83d dc95 d83d de37
i think the following should happen 1 people with a variety of disabilities should be included and consulted throughout the entire design and construction process 2 it shouldn 2019t just meet alberta building codes on accessibility it should exceed it right from the start
2026
it 2019s cheaper to make it 100 accessible now if it 2019s done that way from the start you won 2019t have to renovate it in the future unlike what has happened at rundle and is now happening in marlborough
2026
by making it accessible for people with disabilities you also make it accessible for the following groups of people seniors parents caregivers guardians with babies and toddlers in strollers
2026
are there any delays in downtown
omg your meme is so trendy i mean that 2019s antifa starting pack right
i have been waiting for the 28 on 146 ave since 12 40 and it is saying it came at 12 57 where is the bus
hello any idea what 2019s going on with the 1 16 pm bus for stop 8338 for the 302 app says it isn 2019t coming
2026
bus 93 stop nr 7787 late 9 min i will miss c train again should be 1 16 is 1 25
it was for 9 ave and 2nd st
bus 93 stop 7787 late again today i will miss c train bus time 1 16 arrive 1 25
las week i called transit customer service regarding this problem agent said will file a report but nothing change looks like 1 25 it is now new time
is the blue line going to come at bridge land going to sadletown it has been 20 minutes of the voice saying 5 minutes
what about subsidy
hey is no 33 route for 309 pm at stop 7496
ok thanks it seems the app isn 2019t working for me either
iphone xs
your buses are getting over crowded put more buses and trains more frequent no social distancing d83d de24 d83d de24
blue line from downtown to saddletowne no social distance 61 60 159 i can take any but they are no where close to social distance
is yyctransit app working
it said 19 and 303 were 40 to 60 minutes then i saw 19 then app said 0 minutes for 19 now it is back to 57 minutes
what s up with the buildings why no access no info on the site
2802
oh ok fair enough when did that start
i am on 303
helps if i pay attention eh d83d de02
great idea to reduce the number of services to the southeast when more people are back at work nobrains poorservice
any word on when the bus ticket scan system will be active i understand covid pushed things back hopefully this is launched soon
redline driver just left city hall wb leaving out elderly man in walker struggling to get in some kids on bikes delayed getting out i pushed door open button repeatedly then ran ahead beside driver to ask him to wait for elderly man driver took off anyway
i 2019d say 3 minutes before my first tweet as soon as the light on mcleod turned green the driver took off with me right beside him waving to stop someone could have been seriously injured the kid with bike out and trailer stuck inside me the elderly man in walker
i 2019m furious drivers are there to override glitches to provide safety not risk people 2019s lives to meet schedule in vancouver skytrain door wouldn 2019t keep closing on an obstacle driver didn 2019t even get on radio to say 201cplease clear doors 201d he just kept slamming then drove off
i think but am not sure the last car on train was 7339 you won 2019t be able to miss the commotion on the video and the yelling if you get audio too
just want to let you know that there are signs at the station anderson with outdated information on them
transit users have been asking for ages for less dwtn centric routes council has even suggested the same yet contiinues to fail your wish routes do just that
i would be happy to review the video with the supervisor if required at first i was just annoyed about leaving the elderly man behind but then as i started reviewing it mentally for those tweets to you the safety overriding behaviour got to me
that is more likely i 2019m more sure about the last 3 digits hopefully your camera is better than my memory
i wear a mask for all of the people that you mentioned d83d de37
these guys looting and rioting in masks to keep each other safe
what s with everyone hiring peter mckay s pr person
was wondering when the last bus is
oops sorry from rundle
bus went straight passed me yesterday i was only person at the stop stuck my hand out straight past
rundle ctrain station route 19
ok thanks
oka stop 2219 help me out teletext says this and yor app says this so ummmm what
i thought it was for all the grubs that hang out there and there isn 2019t enough staff to police it
hey there s a bunch of smashed glass here at mckenzie towne terminal
i ve met recently amp separately w acting head of and acting gm transportation re ctrain safety and i can assure you imo calgary and best practice has not moved on developing

the 6th city to publish some mds derived open data is after louisville austin kansas city minneapolis and chicago and they have some useful interactives online and breakdowns in their mid year report all possible with mds
actually we already do have a transit tax it s called property tax it costs you 48 of the total cost of running the other 52 is paid in fares says 8 54 00a2 of every property tax dollar went to transit so an 8 7 increase in your taxes
for example have a look at recommendation d from this 1991 public fatality inquiry the judge recommended that not rely solely on the investigation by
are you going to be making it easy by increasing the price of a pass next year see it s one thing to say that you re working on making it easier but what exactly are you doing and when are we going to experience results of said work

as an immuno comprised caregiver is taking care of 2 seniors i hope follows what is doing
when is the south train arrival at brentwood
it would be stop 3506
youre still charging for fares man
no thanks calgary has sent a clear message covid is less important than money reducing transit frequency thereby stuffing people into fewer buses and less important than crowded protests so no thanks
gentleman at city hall station laying going to somerser on bench and it appears he 2019s vomiting and ill can someone please check on him easy indian wearing a blue turban has a medium to heavy beard
once again practice what you preach maybe consider having your drivers wear masks too
i came back to check on him he 2019s still there but sitting up now i think i see the officers thank you
this is the first time i was asked to tear my bus ticket but since i was already heading home that i forgot to ask if they are giving transfer or such since these bus drivers are asking to rip my ticket
when will front door loading and fare collection start the honour system is broken and the city is being ripped off daily
not riding your service as much as we used to but you 2019ve been great for my parents amp me calgary is a better city because of you not just for your riders but for their family who can earn a better living and pay more tax here because of your support with their loved ones
low floor buses do not seem to be used at the moment
i haven t seen your driver s wear them so tell them to as well or kindly shut the fuck up about it
so steve refuses to wear a mask potentially infecting others if he is asymptomatic typical ucp backer no concern for others masks are there for you to protect others ct you have my permission to ban all steves who choose to put themselves before others
yes i m sure ct needs your permission to do anything soooooo stupid still here always and forever

didn t you just cut service with no plans or timeline to increase it when is the update to increase service for the increase in ridership
seriously massive layoffs and route cuts then as ridership increases busses and trains will be suddenly overcrowded who came up with this stupid plan
this guy gt gt also behind numerous failures in calgary transit over the past many years he has tenure it seems
how about increasing the number of buses on your more popular routes so people can adhere to physical distancing rules
this is just sad to pin on those that rely on you bring back proper service instead
how do i ride transit i don 2019t get it i went to your site and it said please pay but i have to get on the back of the bus apparently and go to front to pay and get a transfer but they don 2019t give transfers please advise
don 2019t i have to show my ripped ticket to the driver
what if i 2019m paying cash
your link doesn 2019t answer any of my questions
so i have to go to a store i can 2019t get to without transit to buy tickets so i can ride transit
and for those of us that don 2019t have a credit card
again i need to take transit to get to those places
i will not wear a mask
again i can 2019t pay by cash i don 2019t get a transfer i have to get on the back of the bus to go to the front to show i have a ticket and then tear it
well you could use your own app to allow people to pay fairs during a pandemic but no one answered my questions
is the 43 running today waited at stop 4557 since 5 19 am and it was supposed to show up 5 31 am never came
thanks didn t think any detours caught 38 5 39 am but puts one way behind with limited service
why is there such a gap btwn 2 southhbound to dwtn at this hour the gaps are shorter earlier in the mornings i need to be at wk at 8am now that my clinics have resumed during stage 1 had the luxury of coming in earlier amp runs had shorter waits btwn
i am not happy with the bus driver who just went by stop number 2844 at 723am just now i have been waiting here for 15mins for them to pull up and just as i stand up from the seat they pulled away the driver didnt even give me a chance to get out of the shelter
morning i hope more calgarians recognize the forces fighting against you and that they respond appropriately at the voting booth and in boycotting the businesses owned by the detractors yyc4transit greenlineyyc
fyi looks like some of your buses are not sanitized this was at 6 40am today anderson station bus 92
hi i have not purchased the june monthly pass yet what can i use as fare for the meantime as i know cash is not accepted yet thank you
thank you i will do that for now
but now that more people are going back when will schedules resume as well
funny not 12 hours ago you acknowledge the increase of ridership again but i don 2019t see any service increase or activation yet hmmm easy enough to make it hard for riders but hard to make it easier

about a month after covid 19 hit the city i emailed the director of cta aj ryland to ask him what they are doing to keep riders and drivers safe he answered me right away about that thus reassuring me he cares about everyone safety
as ridership increases on calgary transit access and calgary transit with the reopening of businesses what are you and doing to keep everyone on board safe are you providing mask for those people who don 2019t have 1 physicaldistancing
what is policy on carrying refundable recycled material on the bus i was told for the amount i was carrying i could be refused access to the bus
this happened last night the guy with his pants down started masterbating while making comments at me not something i want to deal with after work or ever clean up your trains do checks i had nobody to go to
hey heads up a man on car 2271 heading west from shaganappi station just pulled a boxcutter on another passenger i got off along with the passenger but the other guy is still on the train
the passenger was still on the platform when i left he might have been calling it in the other guy had dark skin black baseball cap and sunglasses with a grey ish t shirt headphones and i think he was wearing work boots

going back to the office on monday looking on the website for info on how the board the bus i can 2019t find anything
i haven t taken transit since march is it free during this time or do i need a pass or coins to pay
understood thank you
is there any word on when we ll be needing to get new monthly bus passes as the city reopens
i asked this a few days ago but i ll ask it again what is being done to make it easier
what happened to the sunnyside 104 that leaves stop 5771 at 3 19 didn 2019t show up and it says the next one is 3 49
well that doesn t make things easier because there are people out shopping all the time lately there was a big protest yesterday and i didn t see any social distancing making things easier would be reducing the fee when you know people have been laid off or cut hours
i mean i work in a pharmacy and it gets pretty busy in there customer wise but i also haven t worked 40 hours since this situation began so how does what you re doing make things easier to me when i m not making money like i used to social distancing try harder
when wasn t in effect i wasn t disputing that but i was wondering what you re doing for people who aren t making as much money as they were at the start of the year all this looks like an attempt to sound like you re doing something when you re not
there is a young man requesting to use co riders phones to call the police now he is spitting on the floor of the train 2335 second coach just headed towards bridgeland from city hall
he is wearing black sun glasses camo pants and just got off at rundle
are passengers supposed to be 201cflashing 201d our tickets or passes to drivers when we get on the buses now i have no issues paying some drivers just say no but others are adimant i show my pass confused
ok thank you
thank you to the driver who personally dropped off my friend s senior mom s lost wallet tonight kind and much appreciated yyc

seeing this post again after 4 days have you determined the protocol for method of disinfecting being done my concern for your recollection was in regards to using same cloth without added sanitizer to smear any possible contamination throughout train is this standard
seeing this post again after 4 days have you determined the protocol for method of disinfecting being do 2026

any plans for future linepay expansion to usa canada especially in na public transit supporting 1d 2d code scanning such as amp in the future
thanks i assume th only place to buy the low income pass is online
hi d83d dc4b d83c dffd i was just wondering if we are able to get transfer tickets at this time
when are operators going to start wearing masks to protect us when will masks become mandatory for your colleagues
2 makes doing drugs on platform at chinook lrt please send help
thanks we need more security during rush hour another person had rottweiler on platform barking at passenger
so im confused tou app says no 444 for 50 mins but ur website says there is one at 7 07 stop 3571 i looked at the app 6 56 am
i mean if we 2019re working 5 days a week it 2019s more expensive to buy the tickets this month hurt though i have to walk 2 2km to the train on weekends after a full shift on my feet because it 2019s faster than waiting 45 minutes for both buses that show up outside my work
is there a reason why the driver on the 302 was only asking black people for proof of payment i wasn t asked and the next white people after that black woman got on were not asked seems like a discriminatory policy
sb train is stopped at anderson no announcement from the operator what has us delayed yyc
i am waiting at stop 8974 for a route 20 northmount it was supposed to arrive at 8 47 someone else waiting at the stop said it went by early now i am going to be late for my appointment
i arrived on the route 105 about 5 minutes before the 20 was due about 8 42 or so the route 20 just arrived now at 9 00 bus 7844
9 06 am arrived at stop 5779 on the 20 northmount driver gets out to smoke a cigar app says we should have left when we got here 9 09 and we are finally moving
so what about the folks that need to board at the front because of mobility issues what protects them the hypocrisy is strong with this it 2019s also a very confined space with limited ventilation if someone is ill that could spread through the entire vehicle
it 2019s still hypocritical to keep spamming twitter with this when the drivers aren 2019t required to protect us from them spin it any way you want it is still hypocritical
omg

hi can i take my bike on the train

bus just showed up i assume it would be the regular bus at 1545 maybe
start taking cash again this isn t helpful im not paying 40 to take a bus ride to a single appointment
hi you guys should put more trains on the blue line as there 2019s no physical distancing due to the trains being over crowded and put some decals on the seats and the walls of the trains just like you guys have on buses 201cno sitting 201d
thanks
examples of vendors you can buy them at
you re supposed to rip one of your bus tickets in half or have a bus pass or have a valid ticket from a train station machine
oh so you have to get tix first thanks

drunk or high guy just got on at sait station redline tuscany car 2408 harassing people
especially when they are used by at ctrain crossings
yeah he is in a white plaid shirt dark pants and grey sneakers it was heading outbound we just got to university station and he is still on the train

i am worried about the drug use and garbage at the stations it is scary seeing what has happened over last 2 months with no peace officers or security monitoring
then why does every recent design i see for ogden road south of 69 st show four lanes six if you include turning lanes it would seem and still think it is happening
would be good if someone from and calgary transit access came to this
thank you i know all about that but things happen so quickly it can be too late by the time any security or police get there so although it s great to have those resources it s not always enough and security cameras dont prevent
does the 17 bus still stop at 1st sw amp 25 ave sw

car 2246 just about to leave mcknight he has a green jacket and blue jean s with sunglasses
are the june passes still available
boarded downtown 5thave n 2 st sw eastbound at 1245 pm
just an fyi hes awake now and sitting up now
just want to send in a recommendation note to driver yesterday route 1 bus 6015 at 4 00pm dealing great with drunken native guy and helping out directing old lady opening front door to man in cane even tho he 2019s want still want back door
if people are scared of getting sick on ct because they have to touch a door they can walk order groceries to be delivered via phone or online etc they re cheaper than buying a bus pass
take a look at the time stamp on this ticket says 1 58pm and as you can see it s after 3pm i think the time on the chinook machines needs to be updated because it is now short changing people
great job ps this was the least packed car of a three car train that comes every 15 or so minutes
also want to point out that calgary transit boss is absent and has no timeline to make plans to decide when to increase service and says he does a good job and keep promoting him
protest is gon na be over by the time i get downtown d83d de44
outgoing ticketing machine nfg at shaganappi point
i m currently at victoria park stampede station waiting awhile what s going on now
i m currently on the train i don t know why it s standing at victoria park stampede station while ago
it s broken it just says loading parameters endlessly
hi if i order online my low income bus pass how many days does it take to deliver
as in leaving the platform via the south end like a ton of other people don t mind the gravel you can do it
not once have you addressed the app i m going to bet that none of you actually have to use transit it s one of those for the peons things
calgarians need e ticket stopping printing paper tickets every time buying paper tickets is inconvenient for everyone
i ordered online three weeks ago and it s yet to be delivered i had to buy a single pass the other day i had to use the transit i wonder if it would be delivered before the end of june eventually
i understand there might be delays due to the pandemic but it has now taken way too long i will sure give them a call thank you
this is for the councillors mayors and city staff out there stay safe and keep your constituents safe
what s with the sat bus service the driver either shows up super late or not at all and doesn t even know the route leaving stranded passengers this has been going on now for the last four saturdays in a row i m about to lose my job over being late from it
we went to the farmers 2019 market yesterday and it was like business as usual few masks and little physical distancing worried
this is for the councillors mayors and city staff out there stay safe and keep your constituents safe 2026
i am extremely disappointed in one of my employees wanted to ride the bus this morning because it is raining quite hard she waited in sherwood for bus 129 at 9 30am it arrived she got on the bus and had coins
rout 43 going from dover to chinook station it s supposed to arrive at 923 pm but never does as they are late or don t even show up its getting to be past frustrating when my job is now on the line
this is for the councillors mayors and city staff out there stay safe and keep your constituents safe 2026
i m lucky if the driver shows by 930 but i m still late for work and they seem to forget about the bus circle by the glenmore inn so those passengers now wait even longer
then the driver informed her coins are not accepted only tickets he kicked her off the bus in the rain is this the best we can do where is our humanity the bus had two people on it
thank you for looking into this as this getting to be more than problematic
this is for the councillors mayors and city staff out there stay safe and keep your constituents safe 2026
i don t have any internet once i leave the house so no haven t got the app as no data i appreciate you looking into it thank you d83d de0a
i ve also been taking this same route for over five yrs
your more than welcome d83d de0a
i love supporting local small business but if those businesses don t step up and show they are doing what they can to keep their staff and customers safe i won t be shopping in them some people love to hate stores like costco but they have really stepped up with safety
we went to the farmers 2019 market 2026
if customers don t feel safe they won t go
looks like business as usual everywhere the pandemic seems to be just a distant memory now the most disappointing is the car traffic the city stinks again 2639 fe0f
no trouble with the app calgary transit has never announced if the app is again a valid payment choice i still have it installed from the pilot
i was at ch superstore yesterday no more cleaning carts barely a cleaning station for diy when you get in they weren 2019t even keeping track of numbers when i arrived by the time i 2019d figured out the cart situation there was a line up but inside was busier than it has been
i was at ch supe 2026
i went to superstore yesterday on a quest for tonic water one of the carts lined up for customers to take had used disposable gloves in it i left
we just got back from the market and we were some of the only ones wearing masks c 2019mon calgary crossroads market even has a mask vendor when you first walk in
we just got back 2026
this is for the councillors mayors and city staff out there stay safe and keep your constituents safe 2026
i find the markets are doing the best they can the customers on the other hand yikes
i don 2019t return to any business that doesn 2019t have their employees wear masks i find it irresponsible and insulting that i am masked to protect the people who work in and shop at their business but they can 2019t be bothered to protect me no masksforall yyc facemasks saftyfirst
i don 2019t retur 2026
i don 2019t retur 2026
i don 2019t retur 2026
yes
we just got back 2026
it would be good to ask transit riders who live along the affected cancelled routes on this question and invite them to the discussion
i hope that what said comes true that they will be giving mask to places like on top of what they are giving to the various restaurants so that transit users who don t have cars can still get free mask too
i m glad you guys have setup the texting number and actively respond to it however you guys really should add it to your description so people don t have to hunt through your tweets to find the number
hey what is the policy with bus passes for june i was just told i may not be allowed to use the low income march bus pass
hi are you excepting coins for fares on buses i can not find the info on the website or in your social feed thank you
thanks for the info have a good one
so does that mean if i am getting on a bus to go the the ctrain but only have coin that they will let me on free of charge till i can purchase at the train station
stay at home then forever
bus 29 is supposedly showing up to stop 6061 25 minutes late it was supposed to show up at 1 45 and according to another rider who 2019s tracking the bus it 2019s just sitting there it 2019s getting pretty ridiculous to have to wait an hour just to get a bus home
totally
masks are optional in public if it were essential then you would think govt would create some enforceable rules
someone forgot their keys in the blue line train to saddletown around 3
okay can you stop train at mcknight while i go ahead to talk to driver
okay
i gave it to 8224 21 bus number
sadly i found the same at the new urban fare on 8th last week myself amp our little one were the only one s in masks physical distancing by shoppers amp staff was non existant as well it s a choice to wear a mask but at a min we should all try to physical distance when possible
they laugh at people that contact them this way just call or email them
they need your credit card as it contains your name they need to collect that data
is there an issue with the max yellow woodpark two buses have passed by the sb heritage park station not using the transit way and have been on 14th street
there is a smashed bus shelter right infront of abbeydale school
yes 3 of the 4 lanes of glass were smashed
no problem have a great day d83d de01
what the bloody hell is wrong with yyccc we need the expansion of the greenline i was lucky to spend all of my calgary life in the sw amp downtownyyc and have benefitted from expansion as i grew up where s the rest northcalgary
there was no reason to stop taking fare was unfair to those who have paid throughout hope you empower back your drivers when people don 2019t want to pay 2014 why should i when you don 2019t stop the cheapskates
your free ride is over
i heard rumours that people can t buy the low income bus pass at city hall is that true if it is how come it s listed as one of the open locations to buy the pass on your website
i hope the city is doing everything it can to stop racism in all of their city departments for everyone s safety
thank you for that info
is the bus route 10 city hall coming to the stop nb fairmont drive 78 ave se at the times shown on website
is there still transit cops giving out tickets to poor people
thank you hope the stop is not affected by the road closure at intersection of 4 av and 1 street sw
thanks a lot d83d de42
so no more fare violation tickets why even bother asking for tickets what s the rationale for asking them to get off the train more stigma amp humiliation
i hope the c 2026
is the june pass still available
thank you
i just requested it on this platform pass it on to dougie
you should post your address here maybe the officers could bring all the addicts to your place for tea
your phone service indicates next 153 westbound is due at 9616 at 7 50 am that has not been my experience during last 2 weeks has the schedule changed
route 120 is scheduled to stop at nb silvergrove and silver springs rise at 7 50 why is the next real time bus say 8 30
i phoned at 7 23 and it told me the next bus was in 27 minutes i make that 7 50 past experience tells me it reaches that stop at 7 43 i 2019ve missed the bus twice and had to wait gt 30 minutes
7 42
on my way to via access thank you both for excellent service
is there going to be a 300 going downtown at 10 app says 1030 from harvest hills
i 2019m not sure but it 2019s the first one out from the airport
okay d83d dc4c thx

hello please reopen the stations during the day and unlock the shelters as the signs say they are unlocked from 6am 6pm 2014 southland it 2019s a lie this is craziness
it 2019s mandatory to pay fares you aren 2019t doing anything out of the ordinary by paying your fares
car 2439 northbound just pulling into 39th avenue station
my knowledge on this specific issue is that this is not true reference thread
more to come
thankyou
calgarytransit has said that they ve made masks available for calgary transit to distribute to transit users how do i get a couple
inforcement is where it 2019s lacking
so far each tome i 2019ve asked this question 2014 2014 you 2019re ans is the same and nothing changes see a problem sign says one thing you 2019re doing another again
it wasnt late your app just said that there was no 11 34 bus i caught it fine but your app said there wasnt a bus coming at that time
is there anywhere open i can purchase a june month pass like city hall
would be nice if a bus was going to sit at a stop for 10 15 minutes for it to go out of service otherwise i would have jumped on the other 301 and be en route instead of just sitting at north point depot somuchforbeingearly
awesome thank you d83d de01
thanks was at the main north point station stop not sure the number at 2 45 bus i m on is 6002 bus that i could be on was 6045
right back atcha
ctrain 2412 the overhead compartment has popped open by door 2 in the standing area
going north on the red line i m off so it s probably at crowfoot by now or tuscany
can people get mask when they buy their low income bus pass now the reason i m asking is because according to this website it s available to transit users now in both and
good d83d dc4d
are the busses supposed to be this full
according to the provincial government website it says the cities of edmonton and calgary have each been supplied 500 000 masks and will be responsible for distributing them mainly through their transit operations source
homeless shelters and women shelters are for people who don t have a permanent address people who don t have an permanent address can t get the adult and seniors low income bus pass
i hope that includes the driver i couldn t understand why she was stopping to let more people on when every available seat was taken
if the mask is already on property customer service staff should be ready to hand it out to the riders when they buy their bus passes and tickets in addition to that cta drivers should hand it out to their riders too
couldn t see the bus number this was route 1 at 4 50 coming into inglewood from downtown
looks like folks have spaced themselves quite well
thank you for giving the mask to so they can keep their riders safe please ensure transit gives the mask to the riders like they are suppose to
has the schedule changed for bus 402 silverado it was every half hour the bus came at 5 15 and just left right away normally would leave at 5 30 i 2019m still waiting for another bus to come
i 2019m at somerset station sorry i didn 2019t mention that
so is it now like 5 15 and 5 45 not 5 00 and 5 30 i just want to know for future
ahh ok thank you for clarifying that for me
hey nenshi please rock the green line and help improve the great system has the reason we pay t 2026
of course but who knew we 2019d have a pandemic in 2020 right
thank you for sending mask to so they can hand them out to their and cta riders at the various customer service locations and cashier at city hall
people with mobility disabilities can t enter and exit the back door they enter and exit the front door since it s the only one that has a ramp what is being done to protect both the passenger and the driver in this case
caucasian male and female the girl has dark red brown hair and the guy is covering his head with a sweater
how come ct bus drivers aren t given a mask when they need to step out of their vehicles to go use a public washroom i saw the driver for 1 bowness bus ask someone at tim hortons today ask if he can use the toilet i felt bad when the th staff said no mask no service
good question hopefully the fact is sending mask to them helps them protect their staff and passengers
what time does the next 454 comes at stop no 3782 the app says another 45 mins and i have been waiting over a half hour already
now that you guys will be getting the masks from please distribute them to your passengers you re help to keep everyone safe on board ct and ct access would be appreciated
admits it s hard to maintain physicaldistancing on their vehicles since that is the truth it is a good idea for them to give the mask provided to everyone on board their vehicles
yes i did thank you the app was working right i think
calgary transit said in a different post that masks are not being sent to them
kudos you have a driver who 2019s gone above amp beyond the call aaand in life right now d83d dc4cthat 2019s really a w e s o m e at ogden road amp 78th avenue se bus number 43 from canyonmeadowsrealcanadiansuperstore called the bus 302 wait d83d dc4c d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f thanks very much d83d de4f

website people who can t get them in the various drive thru will provide them to long term care facilities places of worship first nations communities
with all due respect and i really mean this it makes no sense upgrading the ct the exiting system is broken down a lot why not fix what is there and put in more bs where needed revisit in the ct future
it looks like someone knocked over the stop for the 43 eb 58 ave se burbank rd the drivers don 2019t always stop now can we get it replaced pleaee
pretty blatant crack smoking in the shelter at chinook station
hello the buses 147 are small busses and they are leaving people standing on the bus stops because they can t take more people maybe could be a better idea to have the regular busses running in this area
d83d dc4d d83c dffc
your driver making me feel like i am breaking the law because i dont have a pass asking where i am going its none of his business i have tickets and have paid daily since this all has started
just got on the 44 bus 1258 i get hes doing his job but asking me where i am going is wrong if transit wants to enforce payment have someone at each station asking
wish they did that more often i have sometimes asked bus drivers to do this and they have told me they could not donna you got lucky
good morning to you as well beautiful picture
speaking for a few friends and as a concerned resident can you explain why the last stop time for the 169 rocky ridge is 8 40 ish this is ridiculous you have several people this route effects who have to work at the coop there which closes at 10pm
any chance someone could actually help me here i ordered a bus pass online through the fair entry program i received a youth pass i asked to exchange and you expect me to go all the way downtown to get another this was not my mistake all i want is an exchange
ya i ve already called they told me what i just tweeted you
thank you hopefully they agree
is the costumer service at 3rd st open today

i think you owe an apology calgary transit she was right the government of alberta is giving you guys mask to distribute to riders i hope you guys give the mask to your riders on calgary transit and calgary transit access
that s awesome
i know they won t last long it may be good to give them based on who is at highest risk of not being able to heal from covid 19 seniors people in poverty and disabled riders
maybe it would be good to prioritize who gets it based on who s at highest risk of not being able to heal from getting covid 19 disabled riders on calgary transit access riders who get the low income bus pass seniors who get the seniors and low income seniors pass
if there is any mask left after that they should be given to the public upon request these are just suggestions
you re welcome
thanks have a great day
so i called again you can t do anything big surprise your customer service people are also very rude
are the vending machines accepting cash yesterday tried to insert coins and machine returned them all
middle machine at eb 6th street sw station thank you
hi is it still the honour system of ripping tickets or is it back to business and i need to get a transfer from the driver
thank you and are the seats still distancing w stickers i was on a 1 about a week and a half ago and there were no seat stickers but i saw a 1 going opposite direction and it had the seat stickers it was busy and set off a bit of anxiety in me as everyone sat where they wanted
ok thank you
loving the live entertainment on the train today yyc
are city transit offices open to public to buy monthly passes
as a suggestion had out at transit offices when people buy there passes just a thought
now that things are reopening and people are going to be back to work will the times for busses and trains be closer to normal during rush hours
great news
when will u guys be allowing 4 car trains and back to regular service
4 car trains hopefully not until the load justifies them d83d dc7b
ok
too many ppl on 2 northbound unable to safe distance anymore not amused im a high risk over 50 nurse with a congenital heart defect
im on the 8083 we just left 16th and 4th northbound i got on dwtn at bow valley square but by the time we headed over the bridge ppl getting on were questiining where to sit only 2 of us in masks
oh really we can buy it online what happens when they send you the wrong bus pass you get told too bad our mistake go downtown during a pandemic when you can barely afford the pass in the first place fair entry uh huh

hey why is there no physical distancing on ctrains very scary to ride you should require riders at least to mask up what do you think just saying my wife will not ride transit it is not safe
the poors have to get them on the bus somehow is getting a shipment
what i am struggling with is buying low income passes i can t get to the 3 4 places that sell them credit card is maxed due to covid calgon take me away d83d de02
the 3 carts are getting pretty full in the morning be much better idea just to do it now
they re losing so much money i don t think they can afford to have personal policing social distancing and mask wearing they ve been recommending both since covid began here
so riders who pay for the low income passes are at high risk of covid someone 2019s income doesn 2019t not affect who gets covid and who doesn 2019t
people living in poverty are at higher risk of getting covid 19 because they don t have enough money to get the food and supplies they need to stay safe and healthy
people in calgary who have a higher income than those who get the low income bus pass can afford to do things like buy groceries drive a car thru mcdonalds tim hortons or a amp w to get the mask has provided buy hand sanitzer and lysol wipes pay rent on time
when people can afford to eat healthy food get a mask buy disinfectant and hand sanitizers as well as soap and pay rent on time they have a better chance of being able to heal from covid 19 people who get the low income bus pass can t afford those things without help
when we the people in poverty don t get the help they need to stay healthy everyone ends up at risk that is why i mentioned a priority system to calgary transit they don t have enough mask to give to everyone who rides with them
by helping the people in poverty and people in other vulnerable groups get the mask there is a chance we can stop the spread of covid 19 or at least lessen the impact of it in society calgary transit can t provide people in poverty a home to self isolate
but what calgary transit can do is help people in poverty stop spreading covid 19 to other people by offering them the opportunity to wear the mask
on one hand i agree with you there needs to be more people on board to justify the cost of running the 4 car c train but on the other hand having 4 car trains now would help with physical distancing especially during rush hour
ohhhh yeeeaaaahhhh d83d de0e d83d dc4d d83c dffc
is the efare my fare a valid payment option yes or no i only have it from the pilot program yes or no that this is a valid payment

would it also run 4 times an hour after 7 am at the north point terminal
i 2019m only asking cause i noticed on both the apple maps and the moveit app that there wouldn 2019t be any times between 6 13 am and 2 45 pm due to 6 avenue sw right lane being closed
i 2019m only asking cause i noticed on both the apple maps and the moveit app that there wouldn 2019t be any times between 6 13 am and 2 45 pm due to 6 avenue sw right lane being closed just wanted to double check if it was an error

it doesn 2019t have to be 201cor 201d it can be 201cand 201d intrafamily can be the biggest transmission vector and masks can help stop the spread
yesterday about 3 30 saddletown train
my bus this morning 32 is pretty much full what is the procedure for having too many people on the bus it 2019s not a double long bus either just wondering or can you shed some light staysafe
thanks for the survey i have completed fyi thus far this week i have experienced guy drinking beer on train and 3 men with bikes on the train sitting together in cordoned off sections all during rush hour really would be nice if there was more security
would be more comfortable if masks were mandatory in calgary transit

if the busses are running every 33 minutes now could you try to keep the app up to date with what time the bus is actually coming i missed 2 busses today because they both came and left more than 5 minutes early d83d de43

selfish and ignorance d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f it 2019s all it comes down to yyc
is calgary going to adopt the masks on policy that toronto plans to do people need to feel safe amp that others have their backs it ll likely increase usage simple psychology not politics not optics not it ll boost my ratings just common sense
dear i some how managed to get grace again amp she was just as adorable as the last time i thought you should know 31
it s a simple duty amp responsibility for transit users to wear masks who s gon na drive the bus if the drivers get ill or dies it s also a show of respect otherwise we should employ shame that often works take it from a post wwii boomer

not properly investigated by or so i m dissecting it fyi
i am currently on bus 8332 rt 9 the operator refused to let a lady with a cane get on at the front door thankfully some of us helped her on this is unacceptable
i hope more than a report happens this is totally unacceptable

well they converted almost all of calgary s transit booths with these i really got ta say this this is not only a massive downgrade in the interface but also functionality
exceptions for those with disabilities or medical conditions that make mask wearing difficult but mandating will help us get to 80 90 use which will help contain spread as things reopen several transit co in on have mandated let s get on board
here s an interview two days later by on of who is sitting in for the chair of the crossing committee who was asked but was not available starts 24 15 october 17 2018

calgary and edmonton haven t mandated it yet d83d de15it s going to increase transmission as they reopen i m sure many will also avoid transit because they feel unsafe and ridership will drop ottawa toronto hamilton york region brampton etc all just mandated masks on transit
i got ta say i m grateful for the transit authorities in ontario so glad my mom will be able to take the subway without increasing her risk of exposure
grace is your busdriver i am always so glad to hear about those who go above and beyond in the commission of their duties some are just plain snarly and never seem to help disabled or not

anderson station smoking on the platform
with less capacity per bus due to social distancing you need to run more or larger buses on busy routes such as the northbound 43 in the afternoon rush watching multiple buses with no capacity go by is very frustrating
hi is something going on with the 22 lately i usually catch the 4 25pm toward city centre at stop 8651 on wed it was 15 minutes late today the app says it will be 15 minutes late again also any news on going back to full schedules thank you
is selling them
thank you bus arrived 17 min late but it would be nice to know whether i should expect this to keep happening every day thanks for your help
just want to shout out to on my way home in the train with my 18 month old son we ended up being engaged by a gentleman who was quite drunk alhough harmless towards us when he became suddenly violent years the poor man sitting nearby
it was the somerset train heading south we left lacombe station just before 4 48 pm and the train car we were on was 2228
what if it 2019s a one off ride
but not at my bus stop remember there are more bus stops nowhere near ticket machines just poking a stick at you don 2019t forget that not everyone uses the bus often enough to need bus ticket books
are you guys talking bus ticket again
if i have a transit pass ticket when going on the bus do i need to present this to the driver unsure what the appropriate standard is at the moment
they told me they had been begging management for 30 years to put in pedestrian crossing arms here finally installed in 2018 they have seen the fatalities the accidents the near misses it weighs heavily
i catch the train out of tuscany at 6am by the time you get downtown people are sitting 2ft apart on the bench style seats or every row on the forward backward facing seats
they told me they had been begging management for 30 years to put in pedestrian cr 2026
there s a woman on the train heading northbound having a meltdown i think she needs help train car 2338
just pulling in to 39th blue sweater black crocks has a garbage bag and coat with her
thank you so much i m worried for her
and the transit app messes up again i asked for a trip plan this morning and it gave me one now the second bus doesn t exist at the time it gave me and i will be half hour late for work
the app told me to catch the 9 chinook to the university arriving at 8 14am i did that then it said to wait for the 20 northmount at 8 40am but now it says the 20 only runs hourly
i would very much appreciate a response in this issue i am late for work because of it new job rely on transit to get me there i want to know why it gave me a bus time that doesn 2019t exist
interesting the mystery bus did show up transit app still says i have half an hour to wait
if we riot on then the produced immunity will keep us safe

i just paid and the screen went back to the start menu should i buy another ticket i ve already lost but just so you know
the ticket machine on the south side of the south platform isnt working b paid for a ticket said approved nothing printed just went back to main screen
wondering if the victoria station platform overhaul project is still in the works last i heard construction was to start after stampede 2020
are you going to be increasing the frequency of 302 friday was first day of phase 2 and it was full with blocking off of seats there is no room for new passengers and 30 min wait between buses
druggies shooting each other up with needles at crowfoot under the cameras and no peace officer in sight d83e dd14 so this is ok then
you need to train your bus drivers how to read a clock i showed up 10 mins early for the supposed time for the bus and it already come and gone thanks a lot you have now made me late for work
wearing a masks protects others then the drivers are keeping their passengers safe that s responsible what are the passengers doing to keep the drivers safe for the most part nada
not in the station but in the shelter on the platform across the bus loop sorry the right agency needs to work with these people and help them
holy not sure what s up with train car 2251 redline today but that is one godawful noise alarm malfunctioning air not sure but its loud
i don 2019t retur 2026
don 2019t think i 2019ll let terry drive my bentley again wwe pr 2026
a 23 min wait for 2 with groceries ood thing othing will melt or take a 3 or 305 which come regularly and no safe distancing and a 10 min walk home to 4th st thanks
what about disabled who don t drive can they take a access or dats to go get tested for covid 19 why why not
can you tell me how often 65 runs on weekends the app says the next bus is 55 minutes away that can not possibly be right
3986 it just showed up even though the app said it wouldn 2019t be here for another 50 min
1 i know i complain a lot and may be written off as a crank and i 2019m sorry but like tens of thousands of calgarians i absolutely depend on ct the price of my bus pass keeps going up and the service i 2019m paying for keeps going down that 2019s insane
2 route 65 was ntroduced to replace 22 122 407 and nearby 9 10 we lost all those options and now the wait between 65s is 40 minutes and the app has an alert that says the wait will be 45 minutes from now on
3 it is simply wrong for the coty and ct to ask calgarians to drive less and take the bus if there is no bus or adequate bus service when we pay for a ticket or bus pass we want to ride a bus not be taken for a ride or thrown under the bus
maybe if we could get free uber when we show a valid bus pass
the impact is painful and negative and there is no reasonable expectation it won 2019t continue to get worse because ct has been gaslighting is with the same script for years can we petition to replace the route 65 and get the other routes back
sorry for my snark but what you 2019re saying basically is 201csucks to be you go buy a car 201c not you personally whoever prepared the response we keep hearing
exceptions for those with disabilities or medical conditions that make mask wearing difficult but mandating will help us get 2026
thanks i don 2019t have much faith in the system but i 2019ll try i know it sounds petty but people like me who do not drive don 2019t have a lot of choices when it comes to appointments or groceries or anything like that and it stings because we were told this would be an improvement

please make masks mandatory on public transit like ontario has
why don 2019t all the buses have bike racks at least the ones on major routes like the 1
how do you perpose we should keep distance on blue line when there is always 16 mins or late always service of blue line and people take risk because next train isn t behind it s 16 mins after work on your schedule please
that s not concern where i catch the bus on blue line i am talking about keeping distance in blue line when there is lot of passanger waiting due to train running every 16 mins if you going to keep 16 mins service than add 4th car on lrt so we can keep a distance

are month passes transferable
isnt that what happens i thought there were only so many passengers allowed on the buses so a person got off so another got on what is the complaint
is there a plan to make masks mandatory on buses and trains i am hesitant to consider using calgary transit if majority of passengers are without masks and without physical distancing measures
is there any trials in the works for replacements for the ergonomically terrible seats on the mask trains can i make a request to have this looked in to

wondering what the procedure is when you can not board the bus when it s at capacity the driver looked like he was calling for another bus i m not sure what this means for us being left behind
i m at stop 6013 there was a person here who was denied on the previous bus the bus is every 30 min
are they increasing in frequency now that they are half capacity or will the city be reducing the cost of transit to compensate
hi again the 22 city centre that gets to stop 8651 at 4 25 is slated to be 13 minutes late again today any chance you 2019ve been able to figure out what 2019s going on thank you so much
just saw a driver southbound 14th st nw and northmount texting at the stop light bus 8008 route 5 16 51
full crack session at 39th street station 4 5 with drugs visible
4 males and a female one male dancing uncontrollably on the platform
the buses in my neighbourhood are completely empty please feel free to request the transit planners focus on equity and not equality might be an unknown concept to transit planners

why are adult monthly passes not transferable where is this indicated in the bylaw a single trip ticket transfer or discounted qualified fare low income senior student etc would not be transferable but a full price monthly adult or child seems to be transferable
the driver of route 120 on bus 1213 demanded a rider 2019s ticket and instead of a transfer said to write down the bus number and have a peace officer call him if she got stopped 1 2
maybe my reading skills are failing me can you point out where
if i get a train ticket online do i need to print it off or do i just show it on my phone
this was about 10 min ago in between dalhousie heading towards crowfoot
a quick read of bylaw 4m81 makes it clear 10 1 no person shall sell exchange or give away a transfer validated ticket or non transferable ticket regular adult and youth passes are transferable since they are not indicated to be not transferable
if i 2019m wrong please let me know what i missed that would make full fare monthly passes non transferable
hey i left a purdys bag on the 10 going towards city hall i didn t catch the number but it would have departed about 6 15 from chinook station
did my bus at chinook station just straight up dive away waiting on 10 southcentre only to have the bus with its sign switch to out of service and drive past us seriously this is the second time i two weeks
so the 149 to heritage that was scheduled at 26 st 85 ave se at 19 06 never showed up i don t know if it left more than 4 mins early or if it broke down or something but i was here at 19 02 and its a timepoint and it never came
99 and 95
help left my wallet accidentally on route 152 this evening how do i get it back
darn must ve been really early or perhaps didn t make the turn to go to the stop

low income is not transferable but i believe the regular full price pass is
i can 2019t find any reason the regular full price passes are not transferable either on the passes or in the bylaw transit offered to have someone call me to discuss so i guess we will see

that a passenger got on so the guy with the stroller could get on but the driver still tried to drive away without them also you are supposed to be allowed to board at the front with strollers and mobility devices

her masks and we take her shopping as much as possible she is totally alone no kids widowed lots of people like her with nobody to help living in a fixed income how about them they count too
i took personal responsibility you attacked me without knowing anything about me or why i made my comment do better be a better human

you seem to have reading comprehension issues i supply my own masks i even help others seniors and disabled people live on a very low income they count too though

sounded like he did once the person got off
he stopped and opened the doors
please try again with the same company that failed twice 3rd time is the charm

your drivers should never be aloud to refuse service to someone with a bike in the pouring rain especially when the bus is literally empty bus stop 8419 route 301 north 10 00pm i am cold wet i just want to go home driver opened his door and closed it on me
do you if a person can submit a resume for transit operator i know you have a hiring freeze on right now
what request i never requested anything if you want me to have a request i request that your drivers have a bit more empathy and compassion when it comes to the small amount of people left riding transit
please make mask mandatory in transit
i wonder what the odds are that can unlock the mystery of electronic fair payment before the next pandemi 2026
another driver just drove off with my bike seriously what the hell is going on today
nope i mean none of this would 2019ve happened if your driver let me take my bike on the empty 301 i tried to get on at 10 00
also like had they lived up to what they promised years back there d have been a bike rack on that first bus so you wouldn t have even had to be chastised by a driver
your driver just called the cops on me because i 2019m trying to go home
please phone me
this is ridiculous
transit driver just called the cops on me because of this like what
seriously why do they even care about people taking stuff on an empty bus at all let alone so much to cause a problem and feel they have some moral superiority

can you let drivers of the 17 know that 23rd ave between spiller road and 9th street se is getting a speed reduction to 30km h for a detour
good move well done i was wondering how you were going to protect drivers from passengers with disabilities and visa versa when the passengers need to use the front door to enter and exit the bus safely
this is interesting as the university is telling us the opposite that it is calgary transit that made the decision and not the university that they had no influence on the decision who should we trust
it is unfortunate all round the withdrawal of the upass was not well communicated all round did a poor job of notifying students of the change and many still are unaware of the change if i didn t read all the way through a newsletter i wouldn t have known about it
great inovation ct d83d de02 d83e dd26 200d 2642 fe0f
i don t understand this whenever i jump on a bus the attendants are never taking tickets telling me to hang on to them as they don t give transfers
why are there so few 32 busses during peak hours the busses are packed it s gross
they are back to checking on the train i 2019ve had to show my pass a couple of times this month
has a better ottawal system
i ve been to calgary a few times but i ve never had a chance to ride their l
oh none of the drivers have told me that though i don t ride that often
a decade ago they built this leg of l laid rail built stations in one year serving 100k commuters i was amazed how fast it all came together and runs at 80km hr hot or cold or snow storms even the big flood 2013 track washed out was rebuilt fast

transit should support the most vulnerable we can not use transit if masks are not mandated please mandate masks with medical exemptions step out of the stone ages already masks4canada masks4all maskssavelives
then why are there no signs on the train and the train i was on june 18th at 1913 at 39th avenue was packed and most not wearing masks not safe at all and very concerning to me that they 2019re are not safeguards in place

thank you for the curtain to ensure the safety of the drivers actually protective shields would have been to bulky i just hope they were sourced from somewhere of decent quality unlike dollarama

the ctrain arms at heritage are broken
i got a notification that replied to my tweet earlier today and it has suspiciously disappeared doesn t change the fact that i was on route 24 this morning and there were five transit employees not wearing masks on one bus set a better example please

umm what about people who cant wear them due to anxiety issues or have panic attacks like myself

good morning
a segment of the chain on the barrier to prevent l passengers at lions park station from jay walking across 14th avenue nw has been removed broken for a while very dangerous
your turn i only see 20 to 30 wearing them not even the bus drivers and definitely no men how can you police this though
chain is too low ineffective barrier lots of jay walking into traffic at lions park l
let these people know your concerns

train 2207 has no station announcements and no signs outside the train telling which line it is everything is blank on all cars redline going south at sunnyside
kudos to the driver of the 444 bus 1841 for hanging out at the station for an extra couple mins because he did that i was able to make the bus i normally miss going home departs somerset at 3 22 153 doesnt get in until 3 24
i hope that the do include disabled people and seniors throughout the entire design and construction process for the greenline so right from the start all of the stations and bus stops along the route would be 100 accessible
that way both and would not need to revisit and renovate the greenline in the future to make it more accessible this would save tax payers and the city in general a lot of time to include advocacy groups for ex in on the project

please make masks mandatory they aren 2019t hard to get now
please make masks mandatory they are easy to get now
this is honestly confusing what am i doing if i 2019m trying to get downtown from somerset am i taking a train to a connection bus back to a train this makes my morning so complex
ouch i guess i don 2019t have a choice
bus driver on bus 6044 listening to very angry men yelling in a foreign language recordings while driving the bus not very comfortable on the max purple right now asked him to turn down was ignored he needs to turn that off
i cant get your app or website to work for finding out when i need to leave in the morning for work it just keeps telling me no routes found
4777 route 78 need to be at sportclips 130th for roughly 830am
thank you so much
good evening how are you guys doing
i m doing awesome thanks for asking um i have one concern
i m wondering why the route 46 is 38 minutes late
10 19 at the 78 avenue terminal
stop number 5579
hi are you guys starting to take fares passes now my 16 y o sister was yelled at by your 38 driver today stating that she needs to show proof of fair or leave sense when was this ok she had fare but the verbal attack is not required
okay thanks
how do we even pay on the bus last time i used one the driver got me to use the rear door and i didn t see where to pay i ended up paying at the c train station
not quite sure the stop but it is by annie foote school 38 brentwood 8pm tonight can you clarify if this is required she was able to board via the back but was required to still show proof just want to be prepared for next time so she doesn 2019t get put on the spot
gon na need some pretty significant fare increases to pay for that 10 billion green line
might want to tell drivers of your community shuttles small buses they re asking for fares to be put in the fare box which is great and all unless the passenger is continuing on with another bus train twice this past week i saw people upset when they could not get a transfer
i know we are still required to pay are we required to show the ticket pass when boarding is my question i know the 201chonour system 201c was in place i am just clarifying if that is still the case i didn 2019t see anything regarding that
can we re pass this info along the buses aren 2019t adhering to the lowered speed
calgary transit didn t think these matters through in advance
new video out now on my channel talking about the evolution of light rail and transitway systems from 1981 until today check it out here ctriders
please don 2019t make masks mandatory not everyone can wear them some people have breathing issues i wear one most days but hot humid days i can 2019t

just wanted to thank tara on route 3 this morning there was an unruly passenger on board and she handled it with professionalism and respect while ensuring the safety of all passengers she definitely deserves a shoutout thank you so much
hey can you explain why my bus just drove past my stop with me frantically waving my arms as he kept going past me route 78 at stop 8248 can you ask him to kindly stop next time i ll be here still waiting
it was route 78 at stop 8248 it just happened and no i was not just approaching the stop i had been standing at the stop for 6 minutes prior i watched him not slow down waved my arms as he approached he had no way of not seeing me trying to get his attention
can the next bus pleas stop i am trying to get somewhere
yyc
there is zero signage regarding station closure at the at grade entrance at southland station only sign of train disruption is at the building entrance the closed building entrance
good afternoon i am just wondering and requesting if some of the articulated buses could move from victoria park garage over to the spring gardens garage to enhance the social distancing
on the weekends
does the 92 that leaves anderson stay the 92 once it reaches the end of the route in mckenzie or does it switch to the 96 there like it does when it gets to anderson i hope that made sense d83d de48
yes somewhat i have to kill some time today before work and was wondering if i caught the 92 at anderson all the way to the end of the route then catch it on it 2019s way back to anderson and get off at the stop at my work would i stay on the same bus or switch at mckenzie
to clarify if i catch it too early i 2019m at work sitting there for an hour and 15 minutes or i 2019m late by 10 minutes
ohh ok perfect i can definitely do that thank you so much d83d de0a
can you tell me when the next tuscany train is arriving at chinook station screens are not showing the times
did you get on the bus eventually how long did it take for the next bus to show up
the 92 stays the 92 as dies the 96 these are not interlinked theyvstart at anderson and finishcat anderson
it is unfortunate all round the withdrawal of the upass was not well communicated all round 2026
so why can 2019t i use my upass this should 2019ve been communicated much better and you guys failed to do so this puts a lot of people at risk
that 2019s fine but why not communicate it better i had to find out when my bus driver told me i can 2019t get on today
those shower curtains are a hazard for drivers on my bus the curtain kept sliding and the driver kept moving it and almost side swiped someone this can 2019t be safe
thanks for adding extra buses then normal for this disruption it made the journey a lot less squishy and more comfortable d83d dc4d d83d dc4d
there is an expiration date listed on the upass sticker
i wish this would go to the following places in calgary _ the grey eagle resort and casino spruce meadows ralph klien park and other places within city limits so that people who don t drive can enjoy being at these places too
at my school the upass last till aug 31
on max yellow city center this is the third time we have stopped to 201csit 201c waiting by old greyhound station now bus 8297 5 53 ridiculous
i tried using my mru one but it wasn 2019t allowed thankfully my driver wasn 2019t an asshole so i got on
i know mine expires the end of this year

1214 has no sign probably an 11 could you ask the driver to poke the sign
hello calgary transit don t mean to harrass you but the barrier to prevent passengers disembarking from westbound l at lions park station from jaywalking on 14th ave nw side is still missing very dangerous
was third between heritage and downtown 5 10 each time
hey transit peeps could you let me know when the last redline train from downtown westbound is tonight
helps a bunch thanks
route 66 goes across the street from the grey eagle
hope they are feeling alright and not i 2019ll
isn 2019t it written on your sticker
don t know about mru but did inform us by email since late march of this change
my sticker hasn 2019t expired
i haven 2019t gotten an email

that digital ticket would come in handy
can we just make our own tickets at home
only been a decade in the making here
d83d de02
or can we have cards we can reload ourselves online
well the date it is valid to the upass is printed on the sticker so i dont know why they need to communicate that and it was communicated to you when you got it
went and bought some tickets instead of a pass the driver on the first shuttle had me put the ticket in the box but didn t get a transfer just said to tell the next driver to say that i paid on his route don t want to pay again if the next driver doesn t believe me
just going back to work next week but not worth it to get a pass it s a learning curve for me for transit haven t had to take it in awhile
alright but im saying it wasn 2019t the date expires at the end of this year and i got no email from my university
then it should be august and it s still valid
hi there are some personal items left in bus stop no 4331
probably be more successful than electronic fare i mplimentation
right but it 2019s not
hey does route 36 and 41 have bike racks

could you tell me what time is the tuscany train coming at sunnyside station
is the schedule accurate seems like it 2019s a long wait
it changed again
this is form the other side
this is from the other side
bruh
you guys should really shut the train time signs off some say 102 minutes
please do make masks mandatory as a healthcare worker it is majoratively for the vulnerable people i work around and i don t want other people s germs on me i wear a mask and that protects others why not help protect me exceptions for some people ok
please do make masks mandatory i work with vulnerable people elderly and need to be very careful and i don t want other people s germs on me i wear a mask and that protects others why not help protect me exceptions for some people ok if they can not
i ve never seen no one on the trains or buses cleaning them
neither have i
it s too far for some to go for tourist it be really nice if the ride goes from the hotel to a ctrain station by making that happen it would also encourage cta to pick up drop off clients there since they go where ct has a fixed route service
the path going to the casino is inaccessible for disabled folks and tourist with luggage the on demand ct would remove that barrier it would also make it safer for employees of the grey eagle to go home at night
they do but for some reason there employee areas example staff washrooms are disgusting so gross they get featured on national tv shows including under cover boss canada
i 2019m allergic thanks
what do i do if my ticket book hasn 2019t come in yet i 2019ve been trying to pay cash but most drivers say they don 2019t have tickets what do i do
ordered it about a week ago i know it takes 5 10 business days but what can i do before the ticket book comes if most bus drivers get made if i try and offer cash payment
there is a lot of broken bottle pieces scattered on the lower floor if the whitehorn station a piece ran right through my sneakers might pose a problem to those wearing slippers please attend right away have a great monday

gold stars to the driver of route 38 bus number 8313 for being fabulous i ve missed seeing him every day while i ve been working from home see you tomorrow

please make it mandatory to wear masks on transit as more people start using transit it is impossible to maintain any social distance can you be leaders and get all drivers to wear masks we can do better by coming together and protecting one another
calgary transit workers will be providing non medical masks to passengers at several city ctrain stations starting this mor 2026
some people are not respecting social distance on the train i have been in the situation where other people just sit down beside me that i 2019ve been force to change sits or stand up

80 masking can be more effective than an indefinite lockdown in quenching the pandemic 2026 to achieve such a high level of compliance masks need to be mandated masks4canada crushthecurve go2zero
suggestion when making and placing the benches would be helpful if they were a few inches higher for us tall people
i do it to avoid the dogs on the train that you allow because i 2019m allergic

there needs to be seating instructions for the trains people sit beside you without a care in the world because no signs or instructions are posted on trains

and here i thought you were about to quote thomas aquinas 2019 summa theologica
i don 2019t think they are given masks and they also pay for transit through taxes they pay
yes that 2019s my point i think needs to provide its employees with masks and all their employees should wear them just like many other corporations are doing for there employees let 2019s help keep everyone safe
hi the no 53 just drove right pass me at the bus stop and didn t even stop
stop 5023 on bowness road westbound

yes about a few minutes before
this is great could we have this psa in other languages and televised on
d83d de3byou 2019re really becoming cat people i like it d83d de3b

it 2019s a cat what else am i not seeing

i wear it for my elderly mom and my family and for all please wear mask those who don 2019t wear them

just thought i d let you know the hvac in car 2460 red line is not working not turned on
bus 53 brentwood just drove past me 2 minutes early waved him down and kept going at stop 6792 bowness and home rd
they should be putting them in little baggies or something
the stop number is 6564 i 2019m from vancouver and the buses there go every 15 25 min at least i think that should be implemented here as the buses are passing here every 45min
it 2019d be nice to have more efficiency as for the buses itself they are not well maintained i definitely think they need an update bc is doing a good job on this but i think calgary can do better
eeeeew they are just unwrapped
on the route 43 and the bus driver decides to take a break at tim s for 10 mins i go in and confront him and says will leave in 5 mins i have to work i dont want to wait for the bus driver to get coffee twice
hi my sibling s bicycle chained was stolen at north pointe nw yesterday parked at 6am came back 6pm and it was gone how do i proceed
this happened on route 43 to chinook at 900am on 36 st se and 26 ave se
thank you

one of your trains last night would not open the doors at university and when i tried to get the ddivers attention he didn t care

it was about 915pm on the red line going to tuscany the train car was number 2425
could you advise when the buses will require pass to board
the bus number is 8294
i m wearing them for everyone just like i want others to wear them for me and others
good morning
there is a city bus rolling down my street not a bus route leaning on the horn apparently to celebrate a bus enthusiast s birthday amp i didn t get a pic but it looks like there are tv cameras there i m legitimately in suspense but loving the enthusiasm d83d de02 d83d de02 d83d de02
not only am i late to where u was supposed to go to this morning i 2019m confused as to what the protocols are since the other maybe about 2 or 3 bus drivers i 2019ve encountered had ensured me that i was able to ride as long as i paid at the station
tha you for clearing that up then however how come i was denied access to the bus going to the train station even though i had clearly shown the driver my coins for a transfer do only some take the honour system how can i be sure the next trip i take i won 2019t be denied again
i would like to be updated on the situation to ensure for myself and other passangers about this situation i hope actions are taken i was not even given a warning i hadn 2019t even stepped inside the bus yet it is bus 15 stop 4753 beside the church at 10 50am
thank you
thank you for taking your time to look into it
bus route no 104 university of calgary never comes on time today it was suppose to come at 6st 2ave at 12 43pm but no turn up i was waiting at the stop 3 min before hand can t rely on this route anymore all the plan and schedules get affected coz of this delay
thanks but the stop is right in front of my house no bus turned up
seen at the base of the stairs at marlborough c train station doing her drugs right out in the open she didn t care when i said i was notifying you
this kind of brazen display of drug use has to stop
please start double bussing your afternoon 145 busses was just denied entry because bus was too full

i m wearing the mask for the following people 1 my parents both of whom are seniors 2 my brother and my cousins they all are health care workers 3 my friends with disabilities 4 other people with pre existing medical conditions who are near me 5 myself
because i m a person with a pre existing medical condition it is my hope that by example others around me will were a mask to keep me safe
me too i got no option but to take transit when work starts in the fall
it garbage situation in parks and areas is getting disgusting why have garbage cans if they can not be emptied parking lots are a dump southland has abandoned baby strollers amp bedding all over it it this what we have to look forward too

is it normal for a bus to kick its passengers off in the middle of the route with zero explanation saying the other bus was just outside but it 2019s been 8 minutes amp we are still waiting or
it was the number 3 northbound and it dropped us off about 10 mins ago on 40th ave and centre street he just stopped at the stop and said he 2019s out of service but the other bus was outside we got off and there was no bus and he drove away

i am glad people are given the option to wear mask on transit in calgary if everyone wears a mask it makes riding transit safer for all it also beats what happened in the philippines people who don t drive up until recently couldn t get a ride at all
hello are you guys still doing rear boarding if so how does it work will the bus driver just open the rear doors once they pull up to your stop
yes they are and yes the driver will open the rear door hope that helps
thank you so much i have somewhere to go tomorrow and i wasn 2019t sure if the information on the website was completely up to date
indeed thanks for the good article mary
you are welcome
thanks so much i love how you guys have twitter lol it 2019s been incredibly useful when it comes to updates and questions

i wear mask to keep you and me safe handing them out at 9 am is too early for me d83d de0a
you may want to talk to your driver of bus 14 7758 6 10am to somerset station the bus has more than 7 people standing and he is still letting people on d83e dd2c he s nice and safe up front but what about all of us

thank you
good morning the number 4 stop southbound edmonton tr at 6 ave ne could use some tlc there is a box of clothes strewn around in the shelter
thanks have a great day
good morning my friends have a wonderful day thank you for your service thank you for all you do your amazing i love you all
i find the gif a little disturbing though
it says contactless is it barcodes that get scanned like the myfare trial last year or nfc tap based
i 2019m the only person out of ten on the number 3 wearing a mask sad d83d de37
sign of the times parking lot maybe 20 cars two of us waiting for a bus and no busses in the loop
hi did you get my reply
the devices look more like barcode readers than nfc in which case how does this system get around the possibility of screenshots of a monthly pass
many transit systems portland since 2013 use barcodes each fare would have unique not easily predictable barcode so each monthly pass would be different transit tickets already have unique serial numbers how spoof proof it is will depend on implementation
so each monthly pass will have different barcode or qr code
right but does that barcode change after each use a month pass would need to be a time limited but in theory infinite supply of single use barcodes nobody has ever explained how the month pass would work
no different than sharing your paper monthly pass if the same barcode stays it will definitely be time limited likely to calendar month i would anticipate at least a system lockout time so if you scan a monthly pass now same monthly pass can t be scanned for next 90 minutes
but that makes transfers impossible making a round trip to a grocery store
and the paper passes with holograms are harder to duplicate than it is to screenshot and airdrop like i said nobody has explained how this will work
i think once you scan a fare hit an activate button as you would for single fare on l it remains active reusable scannable on that device for 90 minutes need to get the app to see details but hopefully all of this is sorted from trial lots of other systems use barcodes
will you be able to use a visa debit card to pay for tickets or a pass
that 2019s great will paper tickets still work i have two packs still
this is actually a big help so we dont have to go to places just to buy a transit pass
amazing news i have been waiting so long for this to happen and can 2019t wait to use it
will low income monthly passes work on the app
do you know when they planned to be added
so the buses cleaned often at least every night is it just a coincidence that i took the 93 home from work last night and noticed 2 zip ties tied together on the floor of the bus near the bench seats by the back door and they 2019re still there today
that 2019s awesome but 1 question i purchase a monthly pass my phone dies prior to the end of my shift and i can 2019t tap the scanner now what
wear a mask
would you be willing to accept personal and professional liability for personal injury related to people wearing masks who correspondingly suffer a drop in blood oxygen partial pressure
study not applicable no one in this group or on the planet is advocating for public use of n95s cloth masks surgical masks can be worn comfortably and are a helpful source control measure to reduce potentially virus laden droplets from entering the surrounding enviro
i think a more interesting question is this knowing what we now know about the prevalence of asymptomatic spread and the value of masks as source control is there a positive duty to mandate
wait how does this work i can t see his tweet anymore this reply was hidden by the original tweet author sigh for the late comers it was a bogus argument suggesting some sort of liability for mandating masks never mind

will transfers be given out
what is a cw or a cvv number it mentions you will have to remember it but it doesn t say what it is
love showing up to my stop 5 mins before the bus is scheduled to come not seeing a bus walking over and it being ten minutes past it s normal time guess bus stop times are totally made up now
welcome to calgary transit where the buses are decrepit and the times don t matter
yeah i super love just waiting around all the time because buses can just show up whenever they want what a joke of a service
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sitting here since 1 42 so that bus went by what 1 38 i can see the stop from my work didn t see any bus going by what a joooooke d83e dd21 d83e dd21
i remember selina having to uber when it was really cold because the bus just didn t stop for her
i honestly can not stand that especially when they pass stops early though shouldn t be a thing i left work early to try to miss the rain and now i don t have a connecting bus when i get off

thank for showcasing stampede public art we are so proud of this installation in downtown yyc publicart fafard
great
game changer yyc
aaaah i see things are back to normal running for the train doors close as you are there try and open they close and off the train goes
will there be plans to integrate this with regional transit organizations like or also will contactless fare cards come in the future whether using personal debit or a calgary fare card
will trains be back to 4 cars also
is this app a separate one from the calgary transit app i can 2019t find it anywhere near in my app store or is it not out yet
thank you for showcasing stampede public art we are so proud of this installation in downtown yyc publicart fafard calgarystampede csart
thanks i will have to wait till august to use it as i had already purchased a bus pass for july

why would you have to remember it put it in once you should be done
finally
do your operators understand this at all i just had the driver of rt 9 bus 8333 tell me to scan my ticket on the reader to pay my fare i double checked after getting to my destination there is nothing for me to scan if the operators are misinforming people things are
going to go badly on july 1
i think the fares are kept in a e ticket wallet i don t know if you could just screenshot it to share it my fear is a dead battery waiting for the train or bus and your battery dies free charging at terminals or pass is linked to phone number yyc yyctransit
believe it when i see it and it lasts more than 3 months but wow finally about time yyc
hi so i tried to get on the 126 and the driver had left the stop before i got there so i ran to the other side cause he was going around the circks and waved to him he looked me dead in the eye and shook his head no and kept going i m very upset
is there any public transit at livingston and carrington area
stop number 6097 it was for the 4 08 pm bus that just passed
thank you i just found it very rude of him
faq says if you wan na use e fare up to you to make sure your phone is working charged remember paper fares aren 2019t going away
why is there no mention of riders without smartphones despite a lengthy faq section also 90 minutes is insufficient time to complete many trips across the city especially with the current decreased bus frequency
i doubt will appear on this very short list of cities that support applepay with express transit mode 2026 maybe the slightly longer list that supports standard applepay 2026 i kinda doubt it but i would love to be wrong
thrilled we re a big city now convenience helps thx
i hope for the sake of accessibility and safety the low bus pass can be purchased on this app soon actionhall nocontact mask
skeptically thrilled here track record would suggest holding back applause until it lasts a little while d83e dd37 200d 2642 fe0f sadbuttrue
while i m glad that calgary transit and is providing people with a mask they are single use one s people with low incomes can t afford to get a mask once those free ones are gone the app would help riders who can t afford the mask keep ct staff safe amp visa versa
i m so bummed out with hearing bad news that i went overboard a wee bit lol
totally get it
can we buy low income bus passes with this
people on aish get paid on the first of each month if they had this app they could stop buying a bus ticket to go get their low income bus pass on the 1st they can get their bus pass while they re at home nofareevasion
could you please open anderson station it s honestly annoying walking around the entire station we haven t even had it open for a full year since it s been renovated this is rediculous sincerely someone tired of leaving 15 minutes early unnecessarily thnx
ok
more drug use in one of the shelters on the chinook platform
i buy low income bus passes i can buy them online and have them sent to me on the calgary transit store but i do agree this would be alot more useful
overall pretty good one question though is it the same app that we currently use to check schedule and routes hopefully it 2019s the same and there 2019re is no need to complete for valuable phone real estate d83d de04
separate
a week tomorrow i would have started working at erlton stn for the 10th year doing fair collection for down at the stampede yyc will not be the same this year without the it i 2019ll miss meeting all the tourists and seeing all the familiar faces i see every year
will the low income passes be available on this app as well or will we need to still purchase the actual pass
eeeeeek this is so exciting huge step towards a new way of doing things thanks for getting back to me as well
when are ctrain buildings being reopened
must be a problem with the timing board at erlton has said 11 min until next tuscany train for last 5 min
ok thanks
wow someone realised it s 2020 and technology is a thing i m still shocked you can t pay with your card tap contactless should exchange world class parking tech for world class transit tech from yyc

stay safe out there
only 10 percent of passengers wearing masks on my train ride home yesterday lots of people on the train too very scary
yesterday we took a long trip through downtown and same transit employee was on for 4 stops not masked agreed t is very scary more enforcement is needed
i was the only one wearing a mask on my bus yesterday this included the driver who was front door boarding had no mask and there was no barrier between him and us social distancing wasn 2019t being followed either this is why taking transit is a last resort
please consider to add more trains trains are really crowded now hard to keep social distance from other fellow passengers
almost nobody is wearing a mask for anyone today out of 20 people on my bus only me and one other person wore masks
hi new to taking transit i have one question monthly pass is available to purchase on every 15th for example now i can buy the pass for july does that means i can start using it already or only works when it s july 1st to july 31st
train i just got off at was packed no where to either sit or stand and properly social distance why is this allowed
i just had the exact same issue trains was packed no where to sit or stand and properly social distance
we re sharing a busy bus or train car for others it reduces the risk they ll get infected by me about 70 for me it reduces the risk to me of getting infected by exhaled droplets by about 30
there are about nearly 30 people no sitting 1 standing on route 1 bus 6047 going to forest lawn at inglewood now
trying to get home from work and wasn t let on the bus because three other people pushed ahead when the driver told us how many people could get on i was the only person wearing a mask pretty angry about this run more buses at this time this is completely unfair
if you are that worried maybe just stay home
they can t force people to wear masks stay home if you dont like it

full refund or minus a service fee i 2019ll be downtown monday anyway
if the covid procedures are still in place could the drivers please refrain from allowing standing room once the seats are full cheers
how am i supposed to pay bus fare if all i have is change i don 2019t take transit enough to buy tickets or a pass only until july 1 i mean
you guys should consider some type of advertising for this service had to take the train home today and not only was it completely packed with people and bikes there was 1 out of every 15 people wearing a mask and that 1 was me
okay thank you

almost no one was wearing masks on my commute today it was disappointing
you have measures in place to keep from catching covid but what about catching feelings
make them mandatory on transit hadn 2019t been on transit since march 13 and was disappointed when i did again how few riders were wearing masks
i was disappointed that out of ten passengers i was the only person wearing a mask
clearly the app has a different opinion thanks
will monthly passes be implemented in this app
almost 90 is not wearing mask on my today commute to work both bus and train please make it a mendaroy please coughing and sneezing like crazy and they don 2019t have mask on i don 2019t understanding it 2019s so difficult to wear mask

i think it would also prevent more old bus passes from ending up in the landfill
the announcement system on train 2324 is broken but it s possible the driver is shutting them off

i know tickets and monthly bus passes can go in the blue bin on the ctrain platforms and the city blue carts but many of them just get dumped on the street sidewalks and ctrain platforms by people who are to lazy to put them in the proper area
some get their income check sent in the mail at arrives later than july 1
do you guys recycle and reuse transfers tickets if so how do you collect them
it looks like you can t load credit to the app and just use it until it runs out and instead have to buy single tickets or passes is that correct
the engine on bus 7738 sounds like it could use some attention it 2019s really ticky on acceleration

hello old friend glad to see you back in service
there are no riders on cts calgary cts is running empty busses up and down the road
low certainty 201cour confidence in the effect estimate is limited the true effect could be substantially different from the estimate of the effect 201d we don 2019t mandate with low certainty evidence there is no strong experimental science on the effectiveness of masks in public
is july bus pass still available at retailers with the my fare app coming
again 2 is running behind schedule taking longer breaks up by the coop i gather they have a lengthy pit stop there d83d de44
thanks at that early qqleg of a run it be pretty near impossible to be so late now the 1 i just caught to fiinish my trip to kensington hillhurst being 7 min late i get very busy route always
i m confused my brother was refused transit service because he is wearing a mask so he waited for another bus he was harassed by that bus driver for boarding through the rear wearing a mask something i do everyday including today without incident kupodono
excluding those without smart phones i guess because the reality is that not everyone has one
car 2454 display broken we are at fish creek now
i will pass this along to my brother since it happened to him twice the second driver called the cops on him after he demanded that my brother explain why he was wearing a mask my brother explained and the driver called the cops for being argumentative

hey you guys should be running extended busses on route 23 it s a saturday places have kinda opened up a bit and now we re still waiting for another half hour for the next one i see why people don t pay their fares right now there s no point
i am on train car 2437 and there is some kin of pipe and a plastic spoon on the bench may want someone to clean that up
no prob thanks for the fast response

its 2020 people on welfare have smartphones dont make excuses lmao also you can still use cash and tickets myfare is just another option
the trains always arrive at your station the question is which one to take deep longexposure believe
matt some of us don t want cell phones particularly because of the larger than landline costs one is stuck with in the end
what is going on with service on the weekends aways late i 2019m stuck sitting on the saddletowne train waiting for someone from the red line been here 20 minutes people work on the weekends too jobs are important with all that 2019s happening
i know things happen but your app should have alerts in regards to these matters so we have evidence of why we are late when arriving to work and don 2019t get in trouble for it
these are the same people who complain about them being too angry and rude can 2019t win with morons like that
when will the train heading downtown get to westbrook station two 69th st trains have arrived in that time
when will the tuscany train be at 7th st station
some lady sleeping flat on bench on train no 2336 69 st train
wearing black jacket and grey pants i m off at city hall she was still on the train
again you 2019re missing the point cash payments and physical tickets will never go away we still have old folks who don 2019t use smartphones and even card payments bigger cities with more advanced ticketing systems don 2019t have issues amp they 2019ve been doing it for years now
good fine and thank you
finally d83d de0d
great now we get to pay for your shitty service again
what finally when i ve stopped riding transit i can t believe it only took a pandemic for this to happen sadly it was cheaper for my wife and i to split a parking pass at work than it was to ride two train stops on monthly passes
will this work for ordering low income bus passes
will our monthly passes be a available through this app or is it only for one time use tickets
just in case i forget to wear my cloth mask when i go to see my pal later at the park by his place i put this in my backpack thank you for giving it to me mask4allcanadians

can you open the ctrain stations already we always miss the bus because they never wait for people having to walk after getting off the train its ridiculous i feel so ripped off paying for such terrible service the worst public transit in canada hire better
a few asian countries have really shown the benefit of using masks smartly whereas we north americans are more worried about our pride special south of our border

how often are trains cleaned during the day
train i m on is packed isn t there a law saying 2 meter apart does city of calgary transit have to follow rules or are they exempt
train i was on this morning had no place to be socially distant why is this allowed to continue
not enough is only acceptable answer
dont forget the complete lack of security guards patrolling trains and stations
another classic calgary transit screws over its riders absolutely shamefull
safety how a the trains i m on there is literally no 2 meters apart safe space explain that to me please
how many masks each package is there a limit
is there a way transit can make seats more comfortable they are had on the lower back
thanks

interesting it is 60 to 80 percent in your formal messaging to the government of ontario please ensure your amended targets are communicated with supporting documentation to account for the 20 percent delta this will be a point of order in your submission
i see that your website now says the following we 2019re handing out one mask per person but if you 2019re picking up an additional mask for a neighbour or friend just let us know it was better before when it said you could amp would give people packages of masks

when your bus blows past the stop early it is super disappointing with reduced service the train times and bus times are entirely out of sync

to prevent lack of physical distancing at city hall cashiers and ct customer service i hope people can get the low income just pass by buying it in the coming months it 2019s hard to read the ct estore website on the phone print on screen is to small
why describe it as your package of masks when it is only one mask
to prevent lack of physical distancing at city hall cashier and ct customer services offices i hope you guys allow low income bus pass customers to purchase their pass on the app soon that way ct amp cta clients who live in nursing homes don 2019t have to buy their pass in person
will we be getting transfers if we have paper tickets then and if not how will we transfer to a different bus train
so is it going to be madiitory to wear a mask on the buses at this as some people due to breathing issues can not wear masks
how much did it cost calgarian 2019s failed 2 attempts to try and build the ticketing system and why are we 15 years behind all other major cities on this
so will it be mandatory to now wear masks on the bus and trains as some people have breathing issues and if so can a driver refuse that person from getting on the bus
remember most people who live in these places don 2019t have access to the internet yet they still need their pass to go see their doctor their friends and family some aish clients live in these places despite the fact they 2019re not seniors yet
you might have me to remind the people at the train station to wear gloves when handing out i saw one of the people the other day holding the masks without gloves on i said no thanks as i don 2019t no were those hands are clean or not
happy canada day
note i 2019m not telling people living in these places to go out now i 2019m just saying eventually they will and when they do they should be able to get their pass without getting sick due to lack of income like everyone else can

in which case put something on the faq 2019s then i 2019ve been wasting a lot of time trying to find it
when is the ios app going to be available will it be later today or a few weeks i don 2019t understand why you just didn 2019t say that it will only be available on android first and ios later then people would have known they needed to go out and buy a pass

y 2019all need to publish the links for the ios myfare app ain 2019t showing up for people to download
hello stop 3726 route 93 was supposed to come at 9 54 and stlll hasn 2019t come i know it 2019s a holiday but some still have to get to work today
strike one for my fare not in the app store for ios kind of a let down seeing as how the mayor was on the news saying it 2019s ready to roll
is there a link to the my fare app can 2019t find it
i was at the stop around 9 45
it 2019s ok it came 20 mins late but was already on the other side of the street because i knew that the other 93 would come
you must be 12 clueless on how infrastructure planning works go get a diploma then you can restructure
happy canada day calgary 2764 fe0f d83c dde8 d83c dde6 2764 fe0f 2026
what is the link to myfare on ios appstore i searched but without luck
hello is the transit free for canada day
hopefully soon was looking forward to using transit again this month and the new app so hard to find passes in my area cash it is till the app is available
this is just perfect failure to launch again mistakes happen but launch day
oh man
this d83d dc46 d83c dffb wasn 2019t planning on going to a store today but now have to make a trip to get a pass
anyone here surprised didn t think so yyccc
on the ct site suggest this be updated if incorrect is my fare available on all devices my fare is available on the majority of ios or android devices installed with the current or previous major version operating system older versions of software may not be supported
in addition to linking to the apps actually put them on the app stores they are still missing
any news on when the myfare app will be on the apple store some of us need to use the bus tomorrow and would like to check out the app before we get tickets and reprimands from the peace officers
so it seems like nobody actually submitted the my fare app to the apple store really guys i guess the tech team remains as incompetent as ever but how many hits to your reputation can they get away with
i 2019m on an apple phone
city of calgary has wrong info on their website then
sooooo parking is free on canada day but not transit maybe it would be a good idea as to also minimize some of the poor resulting decisions there are lots of cities that offer free transit today
is there a link to the ios version of my fare it doesn 2019t come up in the search
can you explain how this happened you announced a july 1 launch more than a week ago and yet the app isn 2019t available for iphones
do you guys have masks at the customer service centre right now
hey is route 149 on service today
hey when did you start using front doors again like confused
tnx
please provide a link to download the new my fare app to buy pass and tickets online can not find the app on the app store please help with a link thanks
will you guarantee the app will be released today or should we wait and see tomorrow
can you do something to make your new mobile payment app easier to find show up first when searching in the google play store these are the top results and none are the new payment app
can you do something to make your new mobile payment app easier to find show up first when searching in the 2026
it d be cool if they dropped the current apk on their website too
somebody has been offline the last few weeks this has been announced multiple times
the google play store is on android is the ios apple version out yet
as noted i mentioned google play so android
it seems to be listed as my fare to make it easier to find it should be listed as calgary transit my fare
i am using an apple phone and i can not find it in the app store
yeah found it when searching just my fare had to look up on ct s website what the app s actual name was it really should have calgary transit in the title since most people would probably be searching for that rather than the incredibly generic my fare
pretty unimpressed with the lack of availability on ios yet another blunder by calgary transit
thank you so much for your timely reply yes i will keep checking for twitter updates happy canada day d83d de03
what do i do for a fare i didn 2019t buy a pass for july as i was going to use the ios app now i have to take the bus
oooops my fare app not ready for devices on launch day facepalm yyc
not for iphones d83d de44 d83e dd26 200d 2642 fe0f
is there a delay on the redline displays are saying 28 min for a tuscany train at brentwood
thanks
no cash and need to take transit to get a fare
can you provide a timeline is it days away weeks months
how am i supposed to get on the bus when the app isn 2019t available and i don 2019t have time to go to the store and get tickets ridiculous honestly
the app doesn t even work some people have complained about it
this morning i had to take the bus just wondering if everything is back to normal now front of the bus boarding giving out transfers no screens lack of distancing on the bus and no masks but same signage about covid19 rules has something changed
the masks was more about having close contact with the driver while paying fare entering from front of bus and the driver has had endless contact with people in a day and wasnt wearing one nor using the screen its as much about their safety as ct riders
so is the app you are pushing one of the reasons why the sev by my house doesn t have july passes
thank you for clarifying
is the my fare app live yet can t find it on the ios app store
actually can you please clarify the mask and distancing dealio
pro tip having a more detailed tweet about it being limited to only android users at the moment would avoid further customer confusion also update the page you link to for more info as it says it is available on both android and ios platforms d83e dd2a
why did ct wait till the midnight hour to launch this out public information has been collasially weak its like your taking pr pointers from the ucp not a good look your coaches and stops have no app info for riders to learn about this even social media has been slack
hi pls make an apple watch app for calgary transit app and the new my fare when it comes out on ios specially now people don 2019t wnat their phones out often in public they are dirtier than most belongings
d83d de44
recept should be valid enough at this point its a cash grab very poor pr

the only thing that doesn t clarify is the drivers this morning our driver wasn t wearing a mask screen left open mask aside they have the most frequent contact with riders and are high risk themselves and to the riders for catching cov19 esp when passing out transfers
is there a timeline for the ios app is it being moderated by apple thanks
can we still pay with regular bus tickets i plan to wait to see how this all rolls out i asked this same question yesterday but didnt get a response trying again
this actually has made it harder app not available for ios and regular passes not a available at regular stores and shops what a mess d83d de44
sorry ct i would rather not at this time as i don t want one employee to be reprimanded when i m just asking about transit as a whole
oh my yes please wear gloves
thank u happy canada day d83e dd70 d83e dd70
so ppl will start paying again there have been a lot of non fare paying riders the last couple months
did you mean the end of july
next time get the app through apple 2019s app store review publicly available for download and pilot tested before publishing on your website it 201cis available 201d and committing to a hard launch date
i think the issues may be substantial relating to payment model for single tickets amp monthly passes storage in apple wallet availability on all devices privacy amp security ownership of purchase data payment with apple store credit web app may have been better
yes actually the app has made it much harder to buy your fares stores didnt bother to stock passes expecting riders to download the app which isnt a available for everyone what a mess how are you rectifying this
yikes i didn 2019t say anything when they announced the launch because i wasn 2019t going to get all excited until i had it in hand now we wait
except many of those vendors havent re opened do you have a link to these vendors for purchasing
transport for london has an app for its contactless and oyster cards they ask you wait up to 30 min for your purchase to be available in the app it has a 1 3 out of 5 rating from 11 reviews in the canadian store
next question where can i buy more my current package will run out after tomorrow is their a online list of vendors ive checked the safewayx shoppers and even a 7 11 in my neighbourhood nothing
thank you hope you re having a good wednesday
finally please don 2019t beat up on the employees doing customer service today they obviously got hung out to dry on canada day by decision makers at calgary transit who should have known better launching a public service on a stat holiday is never a good idea
you only have 1 dwtn and im at work till 5pm
not available for ios what a joke
just the first of many problems with this app i 2019m sure
why announce this if it 2019s not going to be available on all devices should 2019ve made sure it would be available before announcing
you have 2 vehicles parked in stop number 8451
i think the issues may be substantial relating to payment model for single tickets amp mont 2026
3 strikes and you are out lol the app doesnt work with iphones maybe the city should not try building this app their self and find out what other city has already done this
unreal 3 time isnt the charm
i has asked the cashier at the store after they handed me a june pass they said they hadn t received the passes for the month if calgary transit is trying to push people to use this app it would be best to actually be upfront about it
yikes i didn 2019t say anything when they announced the launch because i wasn 2019t going to get 2026
wasting tax payers
next time get the app through apple 2019s app store review publicly available for download a 2026
no doubt everyone with iphones are heading out to buy their monthly passes at a store today after searching the app store only to find out now it 201cmay not be available 201d for ios devices really
finally please don 2019t beat up on the employees doing customer service toda 2026
seconded
what is myfare app how long has this been a thing
not really wtf the fact that i have to run to an atm if i need to take a bus could pay atm fees and then get a 20 that i need change for nah they needed this on the bus ages ago this will help a lot of people
it launched today
can we still board at the back of the bus and rip our tickets or everyone boards at the front again
i 2019m embarrassed for calgary transit this is such a huge fail why say it 2019s ready to be launched when in reality it isn 2019t
quick question on the myfare app the single day ticket is only valid for 7 days but the paper version is valid for a lot longer why only 7 days thanks
developers get app store connect to see progress invite testers or media to take a pre release 201ctestflight 201d and choose whether to release as soon as app is approved or at future date after approval you know the smart way tied to a launch date
yes i did and thankfully they had one again if calgary transit is pushing to have people transition over to this app be upfront about it there has been little to no news about this app
also launching a new product simultaneously in both platforms is foolish work the bugs out and adapt your features on one platform first if you 2019re planning to sell tickets or passes in the app to candian public using credit cards you start with ios
also launching a new product simultaneously in both platforms is foolish work the bugs out and adapt your features on one platform first if you 2019re planning to sell tickets or passes in app to d83c dde8 d83c dde6 public using credit cards you start with ios
so was the mayor and director of transit lying or just grossly misinformed when they told everyone at yesterday 2019s press conference to use it starting today perhaps it would have been wise to have it ready to go before promoting to the public
i agree that this system is long overdue but it is problematic when it doesn t work properly this isn t the first time though they spent a fortune twice on the connect tap and go fare card system back in 2012 that ultimately didn t even work
couldn 2019t have told us before july 1
any chance you can put the link to the exact app on google play there is not one called myfare
i can t find myfare for for android i know you said it s not available for ios but i can t find it for my samsung either
just noticed there is no space between my and fare my bad
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and can not be refunded appears to violate apple store policies maybe federal law if this is like movie passes c
explain to me why your drivers are allowed to be verbally abusive and then twist it onto customers i was struggling to find change and as i tried to pay on my way off as i had to spend the trip finding not enough change your driver called me a dumb cunt
and didn 2019t answer the question excellent job cc
can i get my mouthy pass on the my fare app
well that is interesting
i 2019m better off buying a book of 10 tickets they don 2019t expire and if prices go up 10 cents you pay with a ticket dime pretty sure you can get refund on unused ticket books too if i buy monthly pass in app then app crashes or is deleted is pass lost too
this is why it should have been launched mid month imagine thinking you could download the app and buy your monthly pass then you find out someone dropped the ball and now you have to scramble for bus fare and then find somewhere that has a paper pass it off to a good start
what about low income passes
one should be able to use there pre purchased ticket anytime no matter how it is payed for get rid of the 6 day time period to use the fare via the app
why most people using transit these days are retail workers and our hours are still the same today all this will do is make it even more difficult to practice social distancing on ctrains and buses
you 2019re kidding right new my fare app not made available for iphones what were you thinking d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f
next time get the app through apple 2019s app store review publicly available for download a 2026
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and 2026
unreal 3 time isnt the charm
you only have 6 days to use the ticket what a joke
this
imagine if we weren 2019t in a pandemic and calgary was full of visitors for stampede here 10 days to 2 weeks on arrival they buy tickets day passes to get around to stampede zoo heritage park b from to airport halfway through vacation poof tickets expire no refund
this if correct there are simple basic laws and rules that you must follow and why we were asking questions before this went live today
they still haven t addressed privacy questions info collected who collects it how they maintain it think tim s app situation disclosing up front to users fairly standard to consider pre launch can people volunteer at the city they seem to need some help in a few areas
201call indoor spaces 201d sure is a lot clearer than 201cenclosed public spaces 201d with several definitions and exceptions
is canada day free to ride the c train
last thing anyone wants is an investigation or lawsuit to city by users or imagine a tourist amp related int l pr needs some serious attention from senior management this project for easier fare pay started up in 2009 thanks in advance mayor nenshi amp city manager duckworth
just saw on the news it doesn 2019t work on iphones sweet rollout team
when is the ios app going to be available will it be later today or a few weeks i don 2019t understand why 2026
too bad reduced fares would be worth celebrating d83c df89 d83e dd73 d83d de00
confirmed ctv just reported it doesn 2019t work on iphones
maybe you should ask the developers testers when it will be ready and publish that date rather than have all iphone user customers check the app store every day
heritage station the stairs up to the pedestrian bridge over the tracks lately people hang out at the bottom of the stairs making it difficult to navigate
i believe this is why they use the city of calgary myid i had assumed that the pass would be somehow stored in there rather than the app specifically it definitely boggles my mind that they didn t do proper beta testing and single os release
we have book of 10 tickets that we can still use
prepaid cards for services with monetary value i 2019m not a lawyer but businesses convicted of violating gift card regulation under alberta 2019s consumer protection act could face fines up to 300 000 two years in prison or both
these tweets are more than enough voluntary contribution to the city in this long troubled area i want the salary of the highest manager who signed off on this
hi there is it not available on the iphone
4 just blocking the way with their bodies and knapsacks not the first time either thanks
this is why masks should be mandatory for drivers disciplinary action needs to be taken if they don 2019t wear a mask
okay so we can t use the app so do we buy regular tickets and passes until apple approves it
prepaid cards for services with monetary value i 2019m not a lawyer but businesses convicted of violating gift card regulation under alberta 2019s consumer protection act could face fines up to 300 000 two years in prison or both
can we start paying with cash fares and get transfers
so when is this going to be a thing for the hundreds of thousands of apple users here we are at the end of the first day and apple users are still unable to get the app wouldn 2019t this have been taken care of in the testing phase when can we expect it to be in the app store
so not surprised is disappointment again and again and they wonder why ridership is down and probably won t come back
and here s vancouver kicking our butts in the easy to use transit department geez your think they could manage this
you can buy it whenever from wherever why do you need to buy in bulk makes no sense
your own advertising at train stations say the app is available on the app store website also says it 2019s available there too d83d de1e
didn 2019t someone double check
why do tickets expire after 7 days
absolutely ridiculous a complete and total failure on day one
where do you find your drivers driver of bus 22 number 8067 is a pure shit driver are they allowed to speed if your drivers hate their job they should quit what a asshole
bus route 22 seriously needs better drivers they don 2019t seem to comprehend their routes what a joke our transit is
unreal 3 time isnt the charm
except a lot of stores failed to stock up on paper passes with the assumption directive from calgary transit that riders would go digital
to be fair vancouver had a baaad start going digital too lots of riders were overcharged passes wouldnt work properly etc
agreed but it was a bit ago they are up and running now we are still behind
i agree with crob
my folks are seniors they have an appointment at the but are scared to go to city hall and your customer service centers now due to covid 19 if i help them use the app can they purchase their seniors pass on it
where is the last 156 from stop 3855
lmao no tf it didnt i was standing here at 10 14 your drivers suck
thanks
is the low income pass available on the app
why do tickets only have seven days before they expire i can t buy a book of ten i can only buy five great way to get bank fees add up
when you will be able to buy your low income pass on the app
you guys should really get a system to tell people how long the next train will be the last 3 times i ve used the ctrain i ve been met with times temporarily unavailable just sloppy really calgary is a great city we re better than this it s the small things
at brentwood station going towards tuscany
i understand nothing s perfect but it just happens so much if the wait time is 10 mins or 30 it could really change my plans i wish it just told you
an all too familiar sight
it 2019s likely out of the developer 2019s hands in those of the apple release team who approves the apps for the apple store that said this app should have been released a month ago so it would be ready to launch today as advertised
i can t even find it on android
they can 2019t afford to do that that 2019s why they both cut service and enforced fare payment during the recent states of the pandemic
it s all good 270c
doesn 2019t work for ios yet you guys are a joke
argh
the city made a promise and didn t deliver at least not on time the calgary transit myfare app launched canada day but it seems nobody from or the mayor s office thought to tell transit riders that the app won t be immediately available on ios yyc
is there a my fare ap yet for apple
several people are complaining should ve let transit riders know they would still need paper tickets physical passes instead of counting on the app but a few are reporting some stores didn t stock up on paper tickets assuming transit was going digital
the city made a promise and didn t deliver at least not on time the calgary transit myfare app launched canada day but 2026
several people are complaining should ve let transit riders know they would still need paper tickets physical 2026
got the my fare bus pass activated but not scanning i know it s just new but have someone look at it please thanks by the way it is convenient no need to go to a store to buy the pass
i d suggest it s not unlike what i have found when looking deeply into safety etc issues at a culture of contracting locally with long term vendors rather than seek best of the best elsewhere problematic imo
i have it thru android bought the monthly pass activated but not scanning when i board bus d83d de0a d83d de0a d83d de0a
thanks guess i 2019ll go buy some singles tickets was going to buy a monthly pass but holding out for the ap d83d de37
saif man this city is a long awful history with trying to digitize their transit system it s laughable really anyone who thought this would be different was fooling themselves yyc
the city made a promise and didn t deliver at least not on time the calgary transit myfare app launched canada day but 2026
true sorry are just words to calgary transit if you were truekt sorry the way customers are treated would be completely different allowing 3 months of homeless people to destroy buses and ctrains not make app promises and when finally start charging have regular bus scheulde
fit their pretend narrative
just fuckin aweful
bus was never free pay your fare and stfu
you want free transit yet bitch constantly about funding are you fucking stupid
no need to apologize giving feedback on the new app thank you
and yet another reason why management there needs to beer shaken up
ridiculous that this is even an issue someone needs to be held accountable for this massive failure how can we trust the app now that we have been let down massively in day one thought i 2019d was tested before rollout we want real answers keep checking is not an answer
so i got yelled at for trying to pay my fare on the bus so i didn t bring any change the next time and i got yelled at for not paying what is it do we pay to get on the bus or not
bus is the 19 8346 this time passengers were let on from the front it is just a really mixed message and i don t know what the hell to do when i get on a bus anymore
we are open again d83d de0a located at 809 7 street sw one block away from d83e dd6f
i know we have had our differences in the past but i must give praise where praise is do this new myfare digital ticket app is everything okayyyyyyy gwan wit yo bad self i m here for it
i can scan my myfare pass on any other buses but bus number 10 why is that how can i fix that because it s so annoying and embarrassing
typical fuck up
the bigger question is why do single tickets expire on the app after a week the printed tickets in books of ten have no such expiration date


that doesn t explain why they have expiry dates to begin with
printed tickets do have an expiration they effectively expire when there is a ticket price increase there is a loop hole for printed tickets if you have cash for the fare increase the printed ticket plus coins can be deposited into bus fare box and a transfer receipt issued
losers
how about low income passes please
you don t explain why once again in small words why do tickets on the app expire when physical tickets do not
i m using printed tickets book of 10 printed tickets that require validation through stamp printed tickets from the l vending machines come all ready validated and expire 90 minutes after pruchase am i missing something
if i buy a book of 10 tickets in november and validate a ticket the following january after the price has increased 0 15 that validation is not effective this is from numerous transit peace officers who conduct fare validation checks in january
i can t find the myfare app in the google play store a search for myfare turns up nothing other than the existing calgary transit app
so it 2019s still inconvenient for those of us that need low income passes
this is not good enough we want answers as to why this happened
how long is the process going to take
confusion due to over the years twitter acct said 2 different things yes still valid no aren t plus conflicting responses from transit drivers too downtown office says don t expire now new app it s an internal amp external policy awareness amp inconsistent messaging issue
thank you found it
by valid people think yes ok to use at face value even if price increase or yes can use them but have to pay top up increase so if have a paper ticket for 1 amp price now 1 25 inconsistent messaging whether you have to pay the extra 25 or not amp what valid means
bus route 23 it 2019s now a small shuttle it 2019s impossible to follow social distancing please check on that
how long will it take for my bus pass to be mailed to me i purchased it june 26 and it 2019s july 2 now
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and 2026
prepaid cards for services with monetary value i 2019m not a lawyer bu 2026
almost every time when looking for extra coins boarding bus w older paper ticket after annual price increase kind transit driver says oh don t bother with it just put ticket in with old price it s fine even if the coin is in my hand already i put it in regardless
deal breaker transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase and 2026
clearly you have some details to sort out how about you get back to us in a day or two once things are a tad clearer and then pass that info on to your drivers and peace officers so everyone is on the same page there s no shame in this but fix it
you already get a discount and the process has not changed so not sure what the problem is
you can also take your pre increase tickets to customer service and use them as a credit toward purchasing current tickets their value never just disappears
passes are available online on the 6th of the month even earlier than retail they mail very quickly usually 2 business days 1 for the city 1 for canada post but of course they can take longer
if a bureaucrat working on a project actually gets it done then he she is out of a job so they show progress from time to time but never actually get finished they ve been working on this cashless fare project for over 10 years
and keep in mind that this is no less than yyycc s third attempt to launch a payment app for this article from 2017
between this and the twitter conversation around whether physical tickets are valid only at face value or valid period definitely sounds like a lack of communication within calgary transit it sounds like your drivers and transit officers are not working on the same information
how come people are getting on and off at the front of the bus again unsafe the drivers plastic curtain isnt even pulled all the way to protect the driver
i went into the office a day last week for the first time since this started and the c train felt like the least safe part of the experience by a wide margin d83e dd14
i wonder is transsubc trainstation the act of using a promise that you re heading to buy a pass as a form of bus fare
thank you d83d de0a
then what 2019s the point of these
then what is the point of these like what
love it
so i asked a driver why they were letting people through the front door they were very nice they said it was because is losing money on people not paying fairs what a shock at least this driver was actually using the plastic screen
they havent taken all of the signs off of all the buses yet that will be removed
great stuff great leadership its been a painful 3 months waiting for masking to become a thing
just used my fare for the first time showed it to the scanner and it said just used even though i just activated it had to show the driver i just activated it for him to let me on
thanks is it possible to know if they will be available later today or tomorrow
it okay me right now the my fare not out on ios apple user i shave booklets of ticket to last me until it out
i agree this is 2020 should have a login system to buy your passes regardless of what type of pass you purchase then implement that into the myfare app
just tried again on different bus it said regular show id for about 3 seconds then went away driver told me to try again and it said just used again it s a youth single ticket that i purchased yesterday and activated at 2pm why is it doing this
i thought they were supposed to be mandatory
thank you
are passengers still able to pay a cash fare on buses
ok thank you
valid point for me it s about limiting transactions
nope not mandatory just a suggestion
i usually buy a low income bus pass i just ordered one online so how do a take transit until the pass comes in
when will victoria park be closing 13th
i 2019m referring to the big project 201cconstruction on the project will begin after the stampede next year and is expected to take three years to complete 201d
ones again the bus 147 to the 39ave station 4 20 pm isn t stopping and leaving people on the bus stops because they have 10 people already on the bus maybe is a good time to get a large bus or maybe you should stop and let the people get on if we are wearing a mark
what s the current procedure for old tickets purchased when there were lower fares do they need to be topped up thanks
on the heading downtown i m the only one on this bus wearing a goddamn mask and i m so disappointed yyc
i thought you had a car
what is a cfd
maybe it is apples fault and not transits ever consider that take a pill lady
where did you read that i haven t seen it anywhere
you are exactly correct too often the left hand and right hand are not in synch the calgary transit staff often don t know the rules themselves
when did this change in the past we needed to top up with cash or turn the tickets in for credit toward buying new tickets
if this is true why are people being harassed every january by peace officers over a supposed ten or fifteen cents deficiency
exactly explain why these single tickets expire in just seven days does calgary transit properly think through the rationale of their decisions
agree brian thank you it s often not in sync hoping helps them in some small way by sharing info appreciate all they do if they know what we have seen for years now perhaps they can address it maybe staff training turnover not sure what root cause is exactly
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can demand to see the ticket on your phone that opens a pretty huge can of worms what rules are in place to prevent officers from going through your phone
what if your battery dies
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026
they cover that one in the faq you re up a creek
charged for having no charge
then pay cash
this is a poor response you clearly haven 2019t had a busy day where you are running around and next thing you know your phone is almost dead
well then maybe we should just stick to cash and paper tickets
um should the 14 going into bridlewood have a driver because right now we re just sitting at the station with no one
this good reading on ticket issue same as we ve seen pay extra don t fun 1 that if you use them per the driver you will get fined just reading thread should give some insight how confused customer is with mixed messaging from various transit reps
thank you very much
any news covid 19 updates two transit drivers test positive
but people have been crying for an app for years
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026
less pot hub when your battery is low seems simple enough
fail plain and simple this should have been worked out before you touted how great it was all over the news
looks like if up to date clr jeff davison ward 6 is leader chair past 3 years responsible for public transit amp launch no apple app problem too lists entire committee responsible standing policy committee on transportation and transit
hey why aren 2019t your drivers wearing masks
what does the app look like in the app store
apple app store
thank you
i 2019m afraid it will really be a case of tough shit
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026
i saw that the reason this app was launched to prevent people from interacting with your staff reducing the chance of getting covid 19 if that is true how come seniors and people living in poverty can 2019t get their pass on it yet
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can d 2026
phone is dead then you can 2019t produce a valid fare on demand ticket for you i guess
why would the officer need to go into your phone you show the pass on the app they scan it and you are done not sure what you think is going to happen here
both groups are in the high risk categories
the reason poor people are at risk is because they can 2019t self isolate when they got no place to call home they can 2019t afford to buy hand sanitizer mask etc due to being food insecure they may develop disease like diabetes
when we don 2019t help the poor and the elderly people by reducing in person contact we may be making the spread of covid 19 worse include their low income and seniors bus passes on the app please
which remain available no plans to phase out
calgary transit never answered question nor updated faqs on privacy found this seems they are tracking location senses if you ll miss your bus tracking real time should be disclosed on faq before people download it where data is stored users etc
will low income passes ever be available with myfare
how come your drivers aren 2019t required to wear mask maskupcanada mask4allcanadians if you want ridersto wear the mask you 2019re giving to them staff should lead by example and wear it
you re confusing paying for an ap and wanting an ap as the same thing
some peoples texts pop up on the screen if a text email comes through and the officer decides it looks suspicious
your drivers need to be protected better since drivers do step off their bus during their time breaks and when someone needs help boarding the vehicles please give them a mask to wear that way the public will be encouraged to wear the mask ct gives properly
drivers deserve to have the mask they need while they are at a bus stop or standing on the ctrain platform not just while they are inside the vehicles
given that paper tickets no longer expire when the fare goes up i can only see disadvantages to using the app
it 2019s actually strike three millions lost on two failed attempts with the telvent schneider smart connect card lots of major cities bigger than yyc with electronic transit pay systems that work for everyone
it 2019s great for tourists and family groups who don 2019t typically take transit and won 2019t be boarding at a location that has a vending machine i 2019ll also be using it for monthly pass
i m not a lawyer but isn t there a ruling that police officers in canada may access your phone if is unlocked they should only be able to scan the code on the app without touching you or the phone when you use the app the phone is unlocked
your tinfoil hat is on to tight
driver of bus 124 enroute towards north point at 9 20pm please fix your headlamps which you were flashing for no reason and follow traffic rules where there is construction without honking you blinded small car drivers like me and honked at us for no reason
hey longbomber i got that coke you wanted and now the cop opens your phone to bad it was coca cola and the third message going up was your wife sending nudes but hey tin foil
i did i got laid off a while back and had to get rid of it d83d de25
that should have all been taken care of before they launched that should have been discovered in testing they don 2019t even have scanners on all of the busses yet they rushed the launch and dropped the ball how many thousands of potential users got screwed over by this
boooo
loved this funny as hell d83d de02 d83d de02 d83d de02
i can t find my app for my iphone is it not out yet
thank you
damn good thing so many of your bus drivers are so kind amp polite because my grocery buggy tipped over amp the oranges made a bid for freedom le sigh she took in stride wish i got her name but i was socialdistanacing
i agree with you
don 2019t let the phone leave your hand keep your finger on the power button best option for the moment
i d still support this
that sounds like a cash grab
first time seeing a new apple app release eh
or got to ride the bus for free more likely you should be complaining on apples page really they the ones to blame and they always pull shifty stuff
thats a good question seems odd they would be any different although if its just single tickets then it shouldn t make much difference if 10 packs had an expiry then that would be an issue
took 31 from lion s park to mcmahon about 8 15 8 30 pm best i can do she had a shoulder length bob if that helps
no it 2019s the developer and transit they dropped the ball the taxpayers paid a ton of money to get the app and they failed riding the bus isn 2019t free you are still expected to pay if you can 2019t get the app
i would appreciate if you let the operator of 1827 know why he shouldn t skip stops and blow right past riders route 156 5 06am
hey why aren 2019t your drivers wearing masks
ios
i checked this morning and it 2019s available
seems the myfare app is working now on ios
that 2019s the way it 2019s supposed to work you used a youth ticket so the driver knows to check that you 2019re really a youth and you can 2019t scan your ticket on the same bus so quickly after the first
transit payment apps should use nfc and be tap based for a variety of reasons but this is certainly a big one
will victoria park be shut down in the coming weeks for the planned demolition
it 2019s a high risk job right now and i can not imagine passengers are being all that precautious or civil thank you for continuing to serve our city
the version for iphone is finally in the app store downloading it now
finally thanks glad to get it but wish i was able to get my monthly pass before i had to spend an extra 14 for two days tickets
you know you can set your msgs to just be notifications and not display the entire content of the msg right
welcome to the 21st century now if we could move away from individual ridiculously overpriced monthly pass to a simpler 201cload x onto my account tap to get on train bus deduct x from acct for that ride 201d system like many major cities i 2019d be impressed not so much right now
police are given a wide definition of suspicious activity nervous a cop has your phone refusal to let it go several texts pinging at 6am even 2 cell phones can trigger a cop
android app
human shit in the bus shelter
if you ve ever taken the train at 6am you have witnessed a first nations person fall asleep i ve even done it on their way to work and the cops transit cops too wake them up and harass them given the question originally posed what protections will citizens have
purchased a single ticket with new my fare app not activated and it expires in 6 days why
i m just glad i can order tickets and or a bus pass online
yeah since it failed at roll out why should we trust it
i activated my monthly pass at myfare when i rode the bus just right now and when i scanned it it said 201cshow regular id 201d the bus driver didn 2019t know what it meant either
this is amazing what a deal
it didn 2019t fail at launch apple had issues publishing it on their end y 2019all love bitching for the sake of bitching holy
you had me worried there for a sec it looks like there indeed is one
hahaha incredible buy
hey why aren 2019t your drivers wearing masks
that makes no sense i can buy a book of paper tickets and keep them indefinitely but the electronic ticket has an expiry date
that just means it s a youth pass it will always scan with a yellow screen and say show id
nop it was through an app
nop it was through the app
trying to get some info on safety precautions ct is taking for covid 19 but getting an access denied banner any help would be appreciated
now you 2019re getting it
this was a huge mistake in doing that huge benefit to allowing people to load up on tickets in advance
d83d dc4dthanks
but tickets expire biggest joke ever just a cash grab
hallelujah no longer is change and or a piece of paper a requirement to board a transit bus in calgary kudos to having had card tap payment options at l stations for years now thx
i accidentally forgot a lash kit on the 15 fish creek at shawnessey at 9 15am could you contact the driver and get him to bring it to lost and found i really need it thank you in advance
why
hallelujah no longer is change and or a piece of paper a requirement to board a transit bus in calgary kudos to having had c 2026
harass them by waking them up i don 2019t understand someone obviously was concerned about them and called the transit cops to come check on them wake them up and ge them some place safe that is harassment
wow man lol you need help
okay thank you
this should be corrected i want to purchase a batch of tickets for the month will be working at home 3 days a week and want to make the one time purchase when o need tickets for the month how is this an oversight
please address asap it is not hard to address
now this icon here your worship is our cutting edge social distancing app it tells you if someone is within 2 m and has fingerprint recognition to tell if someone accessed high touch areas such as your smartphone d83d de01 c
if you ve ever taken transit you ve seen them walk past the sleeping white guy and wake up the native demanding pass asking where they re going
ok there bud you got me
i would guess that most people have never once thought about how the data on their device could seem suspicious to a cop and be used against them and what they might do about it that s what makes this show your phone to transit police policy so dangerous
how would they know if you have purchased a fare then they have psychic abilities
haha why do guys care if you bought a single ticket at the train station it would expire in 2 hours if you want a book buy a book lol
i dont think you know how the apps work if you just said that and only believe that riding the bus isn t free no but if someone showed up already paid for their apple ticket and it was broken you can t believe the bus driver made those riders get off the bus
you missed the whole point but ok thanks for your very useless input
the point was that the app was unavailable to hundreds of thousands of people duh
the question isn t whether they need you to leave the app but whether they could legally take the now unlocked phone and look through it a canadian border officer told me to unlock my phone at the airport a few years back so she could look through it not sure how that s legal
i think you 2019re missing the point when you 201cbuy a book 201d imagine if those tickets expired after 7 days whether used or not that would be obnoxious and also pointless
another reason why this app is a huge failure and disappointment
how do i add can i add my already purchased monthly pass to the app
i can see you are a regular transit user monthly pass cards printed tickets this app nonsense is to eventually remove those means ct said in the thread it s your responsibility to keep your phone charged or get the massive fines
thanks
thank you for making mask wearing mandatory putting safety 1st amp for making exemptions for people who can t wear them due to medical reasons disabled folks amp kids under the age of 2 i hope follows your lead soon
thank you for making mask wearing mandatory putting safety 1st amp for making exemptions for people who ca 2026
i still have 5 tickets from 2019 as i went nowhere due to health concerns and then lockdown are they any good still
probably because many drivers aren t using their mask or closing the protective curtain let me feign shock gasp it s like they re rife with employees who don t give a damn
purchased a single ticket with new my fare app not activated and it expires in 6 days why 2026
no it failed because they should have submitted the app to apple more than 48 hours before they went live with it it continues to fail because of restrictions or limitations that would seem common sense but ct didn 2019t consider or chooses not to address
this doesn 2019t make any sense at all and should be corrected as soon as possible 201cplanning ahead 201d would be to buy tickets ahead of time so you have them when you need them so far it doesn 2019t make sense to use the app more testing should have been done ahead of time
the latest david s tree service daily newspaper thanks to chichester socialnetworking
no it failed because despite testing it for a very long time they failed to test adequately and submitted a sub standard app the developer should have known better someone from the city and transit should have been over seeing this and they all dropped the ball
so bathroom brakes aren 2019t ok eh
thank you i do appreciate that d83d dc4c
stop 5809 2018s open garbage can has been full for months it smells there are wasps amp it 2019s filthy request to have it emptied amp a proper garbage with a lid replacing it please also stop 2019s are missing on both sides of the sign making it hard to read
i know your point d83e dd26 200d 2642 fe0f go smoke a j or something grumpy pants go cry to apple
what about low income passes
thank you i hope this happens let s make common sense common
can we still use paper tickets if we have them are you boarding from the front now or how do we show our proof of fare
thats what i was thinking but the show id thing was only on the screen for such a short amount of time that the driver cant even see what it says before it goes away
you also i hope you get to enjoy some of this sunshine
so what are the restrictions or limitations that you write of you seem to be a ios expert with all your claims with this tweet d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f
bus route 146 at 12 25 just drove past my girlfriend and 3 others waiting at the bus stop can you explain why now everyone has to wait 30 min for the next bus to come
you 2019re right can make this any more complicated to get yyctransit yyc
bus route 145 in skyview at 12 25 just drove past my girlfriend and 3 others without stopping can you explain why this is now everyone has to wait 30 min for next bus
it would show a yellow light as opposed to a green light for a normal pass if the driver sees the light they should know
when the bus has already been sitting for a while and is then running late i have a problem with it i fully understand that drivers are entitled to breaks i pay for the bus to run on time though
again today it seems that because i m using a youth ticket that i have to show my id but the scanner flashes red when it says show id making the driver think it s declined and they make me try again which makes it say just used train your driver s please
i just used it again 5 minutes ago it shows a red flashing light and a denied sound no yellow light
there is a light post at westbrook station that is open exposed to the elements south head entrance
are low income passes going to be available through the my fare app
i reccomend purchasing paper tickets if you re a frequent user if purchasing tickets through the app they expire 7 days from the date of purchase even if they havent been activated
i understand that and it makes sense the show id message needs to last alot longer and flash a different colour
do all the buses accept this now
when are y 2019all gon na put apple pay or tap interac in them buses
thanks this is a game changer sometimes i forget my wallet
why is this set up so single tickets expire in seven days
took me 5 seconds to find it not difficult
buying a ticket for a bus or train with apple pay yes app is based off of thanks yyctransit
it works you are the user tester
i almost bought one 2014not to actually ride the bus but just to see if it works
you can buy one and have 7 days to then activate it
so far it 2019s pretty straight forward in terms for the train just makes it easier to buy things on the way to the station and then activate curious how it will work on the bus
only one way to find out
but you 2019re not buying a book your buying a single ticket
why are your bus drivers trying to make us throw out a validated ticket to give us a transfer isn t the point to reduce contact points
or buying multiple tickets
buying a ticket for a bus or train with apple pay yes app is based off of thanks yyctransit 2026
i called the customer service line and there is a complaint put in honestly i get it with unstamped new tickets but time stamped tickets shouldn t be taken unless its expired it had another hour left until it expired
on june 15th 1987 i moved to calgary from sask to find work i was given 2 weeks by the relatives i was staying with amp on the last day of looking a driver tipped me to a job at today was my 1st day of work 33 years ago amp made me an albertans
having tickets expire is terrible for many of us we need to stock up when we get paid and save them they shouldn 2019t expire ever how is it red deer has a better system then you do there cards don 2019t expire and show how many uses left each swipe
real professional attitude for drivers to complain they hate driving the route they are on with a full bus load route 42 that left marlborough station just before 6pm couldn t get bus number due to my vision
they were talking with another driver while at the station other driver was from the 43 both were complaining about driving routes in marlborough and dealing with people therein which felt insulting to a resident of that area
ooh that 2019s great 1 of 2 features i was thinking would come second should be watch support
thank you for making mask wearing mandatory putting safety 1st amp for making exemptions for people who ca 2026
why do they expire
but why do the tickets expire
why do completely unused tickets on the myfare app expire after 7 days
oh no this is also what i am the most worried about are masks mandatory
thank you as more and more people return to work i wish they would become mandatory
and if dont use smartphone
it would be the stop at intersection 52st ne and skyview ranch landing ne not sure what the stop number is unfortunately
i completely agree there shouldn t be an expiration date on single tickets not to mention how many people in the city can not afford to buy more tickets often if their plans or medical appts change and they cant use it and lose that money there are people on tight budgets
how do you use apple pay with myfare
here
i wholeheartedly agree
caution if you do buy single tickets make sure you use them before they expire
hey at your 6th street station you have a light hanging down
i ve been forced into this isolation and no quality of life for so long now what is normal
yeah 7 days is super short i have a pack of bus tickets from like 10 years ago they 2019ll still accept them
just used my fare app for the first time i have questions about ticket bundles and low income bus passes in hopes to make the app accessible for all calgarians so i will be sure to provide my feedback ctriders
just wondering if the elevator at marlbourgh station is up and running now
kind of frustrating when coming from downtown with 2 children 1 in a stroller
hey just wanted to report that someone hass pooped inside the bus shelter the stop number is 7532 your office is closed so i could not call it in maybe stay open later
i can use my fare for a standard monthly pass too
nice so no more running around to different places i can purchase from the comfort of my couch
i got my pass today and used the app i 2019m pretty happy with it d83d de00
been back to work since may 14th haven t seen one 4 car train on the l hard to social distance on 3 crowded cars
how could homeless people get jobs if they can t afford to even travel to them
thanks so much
yahoo
please make masks mandatory
it worked great
with the new my fare app as a parent can i log in and purchase a youth monthly pass and 201csend give share it with my teenager
probably should consider ysing a pic of someone boarding the bus with a mask 2026 at least for a few months
perhaps only people wearing a mask should be able to enter the front doors
i m starting to agree based on accounts from
thanks i sometime take transit while supporting a person with a disability he wears his mask to protect others others should also protect him
no distancing no masks except me make them mandatory
thank you for the update now that i have already bought the physical pass for july is there a way i can add my physical pass in my my fare app
what about the busses

no distancing no masks except me make them mandatory
no distancing no masks except me make them mandatory
thank you
sounds perfect yes i have the app installed on my phone i ll drop by the centre thank you
can we please have a bus that goes to market mall prior to 11 am i arrived at brentwood station at 10 15 and the next bus available is at 10 45 minimum i have to be at work by 10 45 i thought being at the station 30mins before my shift would be enough time
there s 3 busses the 53 65 and the 408 if any of those routes could leave from brentwood at lets say 10 25 10 30 it would be much appreciated from people who work at the mall cheers
when my myfare tickets expire without being used do i get refunded for them
hey there is a person underneath the seats on the middle train cart on train number 2401 heading to summerset not sure if the person is sleeping or passed out
i 2019m not sure if they require medical attention i noticed when i was getting off the train at city hall
white sneakers black or dark blue sweat pants
not sure if the person is male or female i could only see the legs
loaded myfare app for my iphone but when i look at the conditions single ride tickets expire after 7 days is that right
why
are you saying the emergency ticket i ve carried in my wallet since 2007 has been replaced by technology
works great but i wish tickets didn t expire in a week could that be set for a month i d like to just buy a batch in advance instead of one by one
it s pretty great i like the countdown that tells you how much time is left l a ticket too
making masks mandatory on transit would help bolster passenger loads would it not shouldn t that happen covid isn t going away its still here and will be for awhile
why can t you guys also digitize the low income bus pass would be nice to not have to wait for them to arrive in the mail just thought i would give my 2 cents


if i have a monthly pass new my fare pass do i scan it every time when i get on a bus or just show it to driver
oh thank you
what is the purpose behind the 7 day expiration
why do your online tickets expire 7 days after purchase is there a reason for this the paper tickets were good for as long as you held them so why should the tickets via my app be any different
