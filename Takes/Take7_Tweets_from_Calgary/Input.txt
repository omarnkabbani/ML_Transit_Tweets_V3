what is a deep injustice that you suffered as a child that 100 makes sense now
i had a friend named mary and when i was in 4th grade i went for a sleepover at her house and at the beginning of the night her parents left to go bartend at the curling club in town and didn t come home until 4 am
don t worry they left mary s older sister who was in 6th grade in charge and we proceeded to stay up all night until their parents got home completely loaded
after i casually mentioned this to my mom the next day i was never allowed to sleep over there again with no explanation
at the time i was incensed but looking back i m like oh ya that makes sense
good for them for taking the high road and not telling me that the reason i couldn t sleep over there anymore was because they didn t trust mary s parents who were irresponsible drunks that left kids home alone all night
moral of the story if your kids having a sleepover maybe don t go out partying all night

1 4 kenney got it wrong with the 4 7b in tax cuts businesses left those who stayed got tax breaks and where did that money go to fund shareholder dividends unless it u2019s telus to install 5g hmm
2 4 so that tax cut money just left instead of being reinvested in alberta to add to gdp corporate tax cuts like that only make sense if the biggest regulation on alberta is gone ottawa
3 4 if the ucp has implemented a strategy to make corporate tax cuts contingent on reinvestment in research and development by existing companies that would have kept the funding here to build on future growth and then reduce corporate tax rates for new businesses who start
4 4 even the ndp couldn u2019t have argued that that would have added more support to alberta research amp academia and jobs instead the ndp hammers the ucp for handing out tax breaks to their buddies the right strategies are required by albertans for albertans alberta4al

bueno como lo dice la amiga hoytecuentoque en 2019 durante una protesta en calgary comento en mis pala u2026
el 2006 yo nunca vot u00e9 por ellos y trabaje para la gente se diera cuenta del error y me vienes a decir que estoy equivocado por pedir que llamemos a la unidad por dentro pensaba y ten u00eda ganas de gritarle no me jodas chico pero me acord u00e9 que no val u00eda la pena y lo deje as u00ed
estar todos los que apoyaron y los que no apoyamos este error hist u00f3rico lo contrario es repetir y vivir el odio que sembr u00f3 ch u00e1vez que nos dividi u00f3 y nos est u00e1 destruyendo como sociedad y como futuro

ctvkevinfleming thank you for the amazing interview experience today sophie and i had a blast u2764 ufe0f
i remember when michael brown was murdered and i was naively thinking that all the protests were gon na bring about change but yet here we are 6 years later and it u2019s still the same and im so fucking upset and angry and like i know im very privileged that
i don u2019t have to worry about being killed by the police as a white woman but like how can people have so little compassion empathy for another human being that they feel it u2019s necessary to kill someone because of the colour of their skin when there has been
so many times when a white man who has just shot a bunch of people the police seem to be able to handle it without killing them so the u201ci feared for my life u201d excuse is such bullshit like oh an unarmed black man who at most committed a petty crime scares you but
a mass shooter carrying an assault rifle is okay for you anyways i feel so dumb and inarticulate but tdlr fuck cops fuck blue lives no one made you become a cop you had a choice you can u2019t choose your skin colour

u201cthere shld never be a choice between protecting health amp safety of those workers amp protecting the environment amp health of fns people neither of these are negotiable had we been consulted we would have strongly objected to the false choices that aer is asking albertans to make u201d
u201cearlier this spring premier jason kenney u2019s cabinet used its emergency powers under the covid 19 crisis to suspend some environmental reporting requirements for a number of industries but it said at the time that monitoring work would continue u201d
u201ccnrl didn u2019t respond to a request for comment but the three other companies affected by the recent decisions said that they requested the relief from environmental monitoring due to worker safety concerns as the deadly covid 19 disease continues to spread around the world u201d

cinhumcindy what a great story to read with my morning coffee thanks for sharing
it s okay to go to your cottage if your pc or lib or ndp n nas long as you feel well and still don t socialize or even get foot anywhere where others might be n nthis coming from a guy who does not own a cottage or even a car to get there
it s dumb that governments are saying don t go to your cottage by saying don t do something that you can do safely and with protection from others moreso than most things you can do in town they re hurting the value of the distancing message it is asinine and unproductive
now all that said if you re in power and you deliver such message and then do it anyway you should be held accountable also regardless of political leaning the same for breaking any distancing recommendation you ve been promoting
and when i say held accountable i firmly believe politicians should lose party of their salary and perks when they fuck up both personally and politically because right now they have no motivation to actually govern all political levels all affiliation

between these two disabilities subbed anime is incredibly difficult for me to watch amp therefore is not accessible for me people need to remember that not everyone is like them amp neurodiversity amp preferences exist can u2019t we all just enjoy the fact that we like the same shows
as well i also have an auditory processing disorder amp spoken word no matter the language is hard for me to understand words tone inflection but it u2019s significantly worse to impossible in languages other than english since i have no foundational understanding of it
think i u2019m going to try and aspire to this i want to look as good coming out of this pandemic as i did going in but i need a haircut more than this dude ud83d ude33 ud83d ude02 n yyc calgary pandemic shopowner
