humiliated bus rider with disability denied rides 7 times over service dog failure of management

wce 1 arrived at coquitlam station 10 minutes late behind a cp grain train
translink wce train 1 arriving approx 9 min late into coquitlam u2013 freight delay jd and getting further behind schedule now stopped
thank you for your patience if i just had a nickel every time a wce conductor said that
we were told that yes like told weeks ago that talks had been had with cp rail to stop this kind of thing happening again
hay good news the grain train is now in the yard bad news is now we re 15 minutes late into poco
wce eb 1 15 mins late departing port coquitlam blocking train now in poco yard out the way
wce fail just missed my bus
there is someone with a bike on expo train eastbound car 311 thought this wasn t allowed during rush hour translink

3 buses leaving park royal heading downtown have been full before arriving there is at least one full bus load waiting here
my fav thing about yvr faresaver ticket books is that the numbering starts at 0 nerds
1 2 so it has came to my attention that the c28 at 7 14am leaving 58663 is running with 2 shuttles both packed but the 7 23am
2 2 one runs with a converntional not even a quarter full
what are commute savings
will do and if the wb could be more on time during weekdays midday that would be awesome always at least 5 amp some sundays 10

shelbythom980 yes let s give even more sigh
is there a delay for millennium line from waterfront train has just been sitting here and no update
problem with the millenium line
i think adult fares should be 3 across the board no more zones
i m not married to 3 but i am to the erasure of zones
of course skytrain issues speakers not working on train can t hear issue passed main street as issue train other side
sky train attendant chilling with friends as customers have no clue get off at stadium and back up bus leaves 3 min early
why isn t speaker volume on trains tested as cleaned safety standards
translink rideralert expo millennium line problem train has cleared back to regular service thank you for your patience jd hoorayyyy
drivers do demand payment i have experienced it while boarding with my disabled son
love the tweets you should ride in surrey fare evasion is awful the drivers are fed up
nice purse grandma
sounds like an exciting friday night enjoy
cknw nobody gives a fuck
next 2 buses going for 28 kootney loop
poor people have no money so has does making them pay more make fares more affordable
is there any updates on the 101 bus to 22nd station stop 61816 it s suppose to arrive 10 08s there s about 20 ppl waiting
it means that seems incapable of ensuring the system stops losing
fare evasion really is a non issue you have to look at things in context
please inform passengers quicker it is a big inconvenience since the next bus doesn t come for another hour
let me guess on this particular leg there were no fare evaders were there
of course it s an issue it s they need to get it under control
so proud of this team
it is wonderful
shame on you you have only yourselves to point your finger at corrupt manipulative unreliable shame transiteplebiscite
it s a no due to the fact no one trusts with their money
and the inequity of bridge tolls note highest no are communities who pay tolls
translink doug allen the pork barrel speak eth vancouver
so yesterday our opening staffer couldn t get to work pre 8am due to skytrain holiday hours hey get my staff to work on time

and i kept asking what jobs will these new people have everyone working at dollar stores this plebiscite was insane
and developing expensive investorspec luxury homes amp condos to attract global wealth doesn t attract transit users
try the 10 27 that never showed up enroute now and transfer expires before my next bus broken system
announced service cuts a week ago regardless of which way the plebiscite went
shocked seriously people how did this even happen vancouver
add fire for making a stupid election promise amp politicizing our future
except for vancouver and bowen island
try living here you would not be so endearing to translink anybody can get it right on any given day

the 301 at bus stop 52081 hasn t come its been 20 minutes whats going on
personal bias talking everyone who works for should be required to take transit to from work otherwise little skin in the game
actually poor reason since you somehow never made any logical sense
robertson quit twisting words the provincial government has nothing to do with this more political twisting
we want expansion just dont want ur wasted raises what were raised fee s for how about cut your bonuses bcpoli vanpoli cbc

i can t believe the audacity of to treat us like we are so dumb as we dont know they are a horrible company
the no side win clearly indicates we don t want you having any more of our money to mismanage that message is loud and clear
this was not democracy in action but a waste of time and money
not surprised by the results of plebiscite it s not that we don t want improvements we want accountability 4 our dollars
the bigger issue is fixing the bloated mngmnt first this from a 30y vet bus driver frontlinefighter
it was naive to think that
see my next tweet
more evidence that is part of the problem not the solution so out of touch with reality bcpoli
no bcpoli surprise plebiscite thumped but is unavailable and meanwhile mtpolley review is quietly released
i have never seen such a clueless company is exactly the reason the no side won we don t trust you

kissing ass now
i think they need more fare checks transit security are always busy on the 99 b line
a better idea is to get rid of translink amp bring back bc transit
never mind the thought just do it already

fyi the faresaver on the west side of lougheed station seems to be broken again
lone validator at lougheed skytrain austin entrance is broken again maybe replace it for customer convenience
this probably wouldn t happen if you introduced fare gates oh wait
drivers please yell at your customers to move to the back of the bus instead of skipping stops by assuming your bus is full
is the last 311 heading the bridgeport gone haven t seen it everyone waiting bus stop id 54869
translink just a reminder that you are a drain on this city and the sole reason why people refused to invest in transit infrastructure
the only day i decide to take the bus cantwaitforlondon home
everyday i take buses one driver runs a red light and no they were not committed and it turned red i know the difference
and reporting to customer service clearly isn t a solution because i gave up on that a long time ago
this why we avoid translink bus arrives 5 minutes ahead of schedule wasting 15 minutes of commuter time
fyi dude passed out on train 154 just arrived at vcc clark
he just stumbled out sorry about that

hey folks wondering when the full main station will be opening any hints
our train didn t announce that the elevator at metro is out of service i don t need it but is it out still
some bus drivers need communication skills training or just take the stick outta their ass before sitting in the drivers seat

i wonder how efficient this tapping system will be when everyone is trying to tap on busses but the system shows error ud83d ude11

well one of the transit supervisors witnessed it and just told him to stop but let him continue
the driver of the 503 right now is a fucking douchebag i was two steps from the door he looks at me and takes off fuck you
zero decency from tonight

driver who finally showed duuh i dunno this is my first run derp shows how much they care abt people they strand
this morning it was the 155bus that didn t show at stop 53585 at 530am
you d think if one of buses wasn t on its scheduled run they d know which one without asking me
so basically if a driver decided to kidnap a child and drive his bus to kamloops wouldn t notice until customer complains
2nd morning in a row no 06 22 17 downtown

unfortunately we can t rely on your skytrain to move us
wow translink it s a good thing i have no where to go
of course the 8 is now 15 mins late again it didn t come twice on the times they were scheduled _
at least the sign at that closed stop 50314 should direct ppl to the nearest stop to the south
if you were wearing the bow tie you d have had no luck
that s why translink needs more of your money
does the 96 b line newton exchange run all night

fully operational quite empty let passengers off pointed to back another bus came 4 min later which had more people on board
what is going on there is a huge line in stanley park loop and two buses parked with no drivers
just a suggestion thanks yeah it s mainly the fare gate ones they re worse than the standalone blue tap pads
there is a bicycle on train 338 heading to broadway commercial eastbound
i was wondering this too but i realized it s so they can check that you have the right zone pass without cops
how can the 143 coquitlam be 10 mins late when the duration of the first bus loop and the second one is literally a 2 min drive
ooh dear the man is singing now and still burping lol this is too funny vancouver
no worries though cus three 145 buses have gone by
i wait 44 minutes for a bus missing three scheduled buses and the first one it is full this is bull shit
just went by government st exit on hwy1 still blocked off hope it s open by monday or new route 555 will be a mess

service for the 8 has been particularly bad lately just fyi second time this week the bus has been super late like this
thanks would be helpful to have some kind of map guide overview so people heading for ferry know how much and how to get there
when will your bus drivers learn that their job is not to race to their final stop and they should stick to their schedules
whats up with 2164 got kicked off

driver dropped off 20 people at 59803 instead of 59767 took extra hour to get home tooted as he zoomed by reala hole
are you taking your ball and going home bunch of clowns why not figure out how to fix your mess before you ask for more
did yes ads inform of this no oh
but i bet everyone gets raises
i think that s exactly the reason i use on an almost daily basis
is translink threatening us the goddamn arrogance of these over paid jackasses
what s the holdup for trains leaving waterfront
been waiting for an expo line for almost 10 mins
that s been their whole argument the sky will fall if we don t win find the money in current budgets incl muni ones

what s going on with the 19 stop 58728 it s just stopped at the station
why are there so many delays with the 22 knight bus 3 buses did not come on time and we are still waiting
out of curiosity do your buses have ac at all nit s very hard to breath when it s 25 degrees and the bus is packed
this is ridiculous there s about 70 people waiting for the bus and now there s four of them and no drivers in sight
any issues with 050 route waiting at 52060 for 23 minutes mobile app shows now but no bus
there s a lot of people at main and terminal wondering about a detour for 3 8 19 due to accident at the viaduct
yes we did thank you for your time
that s new then used to have to take the 100 to get to marine drive and because the timing point is at the loop
well maybe check with your drivers because there is a lot of verbal abuse flying from customers and drivers
yo homie what is wrong with the 19 bus i ve been waiting for hours 50659
i have never had a bus driver turn on the ac it s suffocating nand the 123 from new west that left at 3 23pm
slows the busses down to the point where it s faster to just take the ten downtown
i don t ask for much but it is possible to deploy as many if not all a c ed buses on the road this heat wave
also the 3 06 bus just left
still waiting been at stop for 37 minutes
absolutely ridiculous that i have to pay 4 00 to go one stop to get home because of the multiple zone policy thanksbutnothanks
210 canada line suitcase has appeared to be left on train
you may want to send someone to put a sign up as there are a lot of people there still
had to wait 45 minutes bcuz the 143 didnt come 3 different times then had to pay for 2 zones because the 143 goes to burnaby once
rather send out as much of the 90s d40lfs as possible
made it but i m wondering why mob app showed now with no bus too hot to be outside waiting on no shows
the driver on 101 bus p3341 today has a creepy habit of hitting on every underage girl who gets on the bus

translink left a male foreign senior wrenching on the back door because the green light wasn t on w people shouting backdoor pt 2
why do the 17 buses always hunt in packs of 3
translink and the third was a complete lack of social etiquette among passengers usually as a cause of not enough expressed expectation 3
got off at thrift and johnston around 4 00 pm thank you
welcome feel free to share the photo
standing at coquitlam bus loop waiting for the 160 to vancouver 10 min late is one broken down one on its way
is something going on with the 3 or 8 nothing has come in 30 mins stop 50035
i ve been at the bus stop at burrard station for 20 min any idea where the 5 is
opening the windows on a skytrain car equipped with ac defeats the purpose lets keep them closed so the ac can do its job
when it s 30 degrees outside some air conditioning that does something would be helpful in buses
any news on the 2 or 22 at stop 50072 it s been 15
why are their trains out here that have no a c in this heat it is insane that a fan is just blowing around hot air
no idea the train number

i m late for work now due to the ramp not going back in to the buss 203 going from aldergrove to langley sitting here 5 min
the driver was told to just wait now there is a bus full of 13 people who are late
estimated time and what can be done about the stop to fix this from happening
why is this presented as a now or never issue give it two years and a lot of housecleaning by tl possible yes
details needed how much business do pattison companies do with will there be conflict of interest rules transit plebiscite
now we are bing told to wait till the next bus comes in 15 min what about everyone s bus tickets
so half hour wait what are you going to do for all of us stuck here
thankfully one media guy didn t drink the koolaid how many developers will be on the board maxing their profits
20 min to get the buss to drive back then drive forward seriously you could not relay over the phone
are we to expect these on the sides of transit buses and trains
look at pattison holdings along the proposed routes and contracts conflict
shouldn t be proud about getting an award for wasteful spending not cool teddyaward joefontana pretty sad
what next they are throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink my opinion
i too question how much investment businesses pattison signs does with translink
crazy bus driver slamming breaks unnecessarily just went flying into a poor unsuspecting fellow user ugh
we are ok thanks it was just a shock
many of us still think that most of the money raised will go to translink s executives pockets
translink should be run like ever other buisness family run businesses don t get handouts
anything to do with is frightening
well for starters gregor gave pattison a lifetime free parking in the city in june 2014

some hobo just got on the bus without paying a passenger threatened to beat him up
how many projects you guys plan to do finish what you started first statement
the hobo became verbally abusive towards the passenger and the bus driver and the driver called your cops on the hobo
you realize has always said increased ridership will occur to fund their plans it hasn t 5 becomes 1 or 2 very quickly
the driver just didn t like the hobo because he was freeloadin but it was clearly the passenger who iniated threats of violence
what about money spent by over all executive salaries operational expenses will they report on that
i don t think its ok for drivers to tolerate threats of violents from passengers towards anyone fare payer or not
translink did something to save people 130 million and no one noticed by
this is a desperate stunt and a further insult to txpayer rmember all the yes puppets in gov for next elctns
think on a longer time scale investment in transit is required for our city to not turn into a gridlock hell
not really they basically raised 130 million in bond loans they still need to be paid back
does pattison even know what a bus is billionaires in charge bank collapse anyone
including his yacht s
the public doesn t trust so let s get that billionaire who made his fortune selling cars to oversee the new transit funding

we don t agree has in many ways given us a world class system the envy of cities across namerica

any notification about buses 501 dropping service due to break down kind of important you can tweet delays but not breakdowns
i did call customer service and looked around the entire station for an employee i was told i would have to wait up to 25 min
for someone to find me i don t have 25 minutes to wait at a station doesn t sound like a good way to solve problems

any sign of wb 33s am at stop 61118 haven t seen one in 15 minutes
i agree drivers not handling cash bit but simple secured box for folks to drop in fares would be an easy solution
yes people seem to be confused by the direction arrows are pointing and such could just be laziness too i guess
i watched people shove in front of a poor lady with a walker to get on the elevator though so maybe a staff person thank you u263a
thanks it was the 7 50 i d been hoping to get but i appreciate it was out of your control cheers

infographic answers to society s most pressing questions today awkward transit interactions unbouncing
bus 2263 9wb isn t displaying or announcing stops was stuck at back so couldn t notify driver
what bus is it from edmonds to marine and byrne thanks
why are skytrain s so packed this afternoon you need better train frequencies
do u support call for that would reward transit users for improving their health transitplebiscite
use of the skytrain pa system for anything other than emergencies is simply noise pollution
neal always the gentleman looking out for his fellow vancouverites
has zero accountability they are not elected and do lot have to answer to anyone why should we believe zero credibility
the train was packed at 14 30 and please don t blame the long weekend
i ride the trains everyday the same time and waited at granville station for over 7 minutes that was very unusual
when there s a problem find out be honest and solve it instead of blaming on other things that s the mature way
so i m guessing when a skytrain car comes to an instant and dead stop the doors aren t supposed to open a good three inches
what happened to the 232 that s supposed to be northbound at lonsdale amp 13th at 4 02 been waiting almost 20 mins now
yes but it is still a ripoff
3 person maintenance crew at royal oak with one weed whacker cutting the grass remind me again why do you need more money
having transit security on bikes downtown for the summer is an outstanding idea kudos for keeping transit safe
i am well aware that 135 does not use that stop particularly as it s on commercial the 020 seemed to think that the bus 1 2
somewhat behind it might stop as he honked and didn t stop however the bus behind him was a 135 had to wait for next 20 2 2
where is the 44 i m waiting at burrard station
r u trying to get an accusation out of me why don t u ask that driver really classy way to end the week thanks translink
will there be another track maintenance tonight
any update on 44 hasn t arrived at ubc
thanks for reply will let the loooong line of waiting riders know
in anticipation of tonight s event at my piece on literally a social media strategy
customer service is just awful thank goodness for radar app and good bus drivers oh boy ud83d ude4f lots of prayers today
wow that s fantastic news thanks for the update
can u guys make an app that sets off an alarm and wakes me up when the bus is at my stop missedmystopagain fellasleep woops

not sure i was at the very back but i don t think so
plz tell bus driver that is driving the 26 to joyce bus number 9443 to slow the heck down i want to make it home alive
96 leaving bay 11 surrey central station to new exchange bus driver of s8008 allowed 3 4 of the bus on thru back back
where is the next stop for the 211 from seymour at pender
yes when i have a few
car 021 door c d3 doesn t open going now on expo
bus drivers seem happier than those at the ttc doubt they get paid any better
and now it does
that needs to be on the temporary sign i don t usually take this route luckily i have a phone to look up the route
person just stood in front of the bus door and caused it to delay an extra 15seconds driver yells back at passenger rudely
invest in some customer service training for your grumpy ass drivers
none of your ticket machines are in service waterfront station get with it guys
at tweeting is a full time job and that s a good thing vanpoli hootupbcb
waterfront canada line one of the three are covered in a black shroud and the other two are out of service
lineup for 44 at ubc today at 430pm wait time 45mins ridiculous
watched three 84 buses come and go same route no delay for 84
do u support call 4 that would reward transit users 4 improving their health transitplebiscite
do u support call 4 that would reward transit users 4 improving their health transitplebiscite
feeling the heat at hootupbcb
i think is the gold standard for how to deal with likely expected negativity on social respect hootupbcb
they really do a heck of a job serious respect ud83d udc4a hootupbcb
wow hearing from actually makes me like maybe just a little more at least their socialmedia team ud83d ude09 hootupbcb
i really want to start a u201crules we didn u2019t know we had u201d blog hootupbcb
i love the social media team
any idea where the 7 10 555 bus leaving braid is
555 leaving from braid was supposed to leave almost 10 minutes ago bus is sitting nearby it arrived 20 minutes ago
translink turns the darkness into light talk and address the issues that come up on social hootupbcb jedipower
aw bus literally just arrived still have to load an entire bus full before we can go
14 minutes late not a huge deal but not great either
translink bus555 late to depart for 15 mins whats going on suppose to leave by 7 10 didn t leave till now
transitpolice transit tix blitz at granville stn right now every officer is writing someone a ticket
transitpolice tix blitz at granville stn so successful one officer just ran out of tickets to issue
thank you to 157 driver who made sure i knew where i was going tonight didn t get ticket stamped for 8 06 at lougheed stn
any idea when the 50 is to be at stop 50040 the mobile site has said 9 minutes for the past few minutes
waiting bus stop 51526 25 in vancouver bc
remember that bike to work week is also don t drive to work week so public transit counts too cc
i had already bought a ticket
any idea where the 323 to surrey central at 102 a and 128 st is it is late
actually no but is not elected to lead it is mandated to run a transportation system
leadership is an activity not a position you lead from where you are running the system includes funding it
tv screens block view of sign indicating train destination at waterfront stn expo mill when walking to platform can you fix
holy moly bus hurry up
soooo is there a reason why 96 a bus that leaves every 8 minutes or so have been missing for the past 25 minutes
vancouver research by shows that earns an a grade for transit operations yesfortransit
why do i always get stuck seated in front of the crotch scratchers on public transit just rude you need a poster for that
seriously when this happens wake one of those overpaid executives up and get them driving a bus
where s da 97 at
dw it came ud83d ude18
the 9 15 502 bus just flew past my stop 10 minutes late with a nis sign 1 2 full stop 58164
604commuter i think directed that q at you not me there s probably some waste but receives good reviews
stadium station thirty minutes two skytrains both full what gives
forcing patrons who use the service to pay for it is very evil and right wing
you ve got a big problem now that event at rogers arena just ended too
bus 97 to lougheed stn are their delays the bus never came at 9 23 and 9 38
a one day blitz then they will return to anonymity
and just because today hasn t sucked quite enough yet my bus has been 7 minutes away for the last 12 minutes straight fml
need more 188 late night buses taking c38 from poco and still have to walk a block and a half is tiring and scary at night
noticed road work on king george is the 96 guilford affected today tomorrow thanks
ppl have been waiting for the 97 b line for quite a while anything happened 58435
what is going on with the trains whyarewenotmoving
you better send more than one bus or there is going to be some pretty pissed ppl
you re doing it wrong translink apparently the suburbs don t matter
where s the 33 bus 50419 it should have came at 10 28
no clue but you need more bus service to the suburbs
didn t wait cldn t trust bus 30 min later wld have space grabbed another bus part way reserved for the rest
a heads up would have been nice would have sprung for a can trackmaintenance fail
where is this 33 please plenty of people waiting
a heads up would have been nice would have grabbed a cab trackmaintenance fail
that can t be true a group of people have been here since 10 20
what s wrong with skytrain

how am i supposed to get from waterfront station to surrey when skytrain is down and no bus bridges set up i m stuck in vancity
i ve already missed my last bus home thanks anyway
rather than ask for more money for equipment fix the stuff yoi have already
yoy should make speaker announcements on skytrains louder no one can hear when the windows are open

and stop increasing fares every single year
thanks for the reply u201c translink currently there is no eta at this time and no details on the cause of the issue sb u201d

translink really sorry this happened and bus bridge took jd why so they can brush it under the rug

huge props to skytrain staff at joyce station for executing on contingency plan not so much love for for service delays
just double checking could i train from renfrew to new westminster
is the millennium line going from columbia to gilmore what are the delays if so
i m assuming vcc comm renfrew to columbia
if we need to get to nanaimo to catch the 25 what are we supposed to do
no skytrain service past joyce downtown commuters that means you bus bridge is slow and packed best take mellenium to bway
99 to canada line and get downtown
wan na tweet the actual problem that might help
yes of course sorry just 4 hrs sleep
hard to be positive when it goes down twice in 4 days boo
fastest way to get to ubc from king george
at this point you can t even be pissed at the skytrain issues it s your own fault for thinking is reliable grabacoffee
does anyone know if mill line is running to gilmore from columbia how long are delays
millennium line is working just fine guess it will just be a longer trip ud83d ude36
skytrain is closed past joyce bus bridge is slow and packed best route for downtown is mellenium to bway and 99 to canada lne
would i be able to get from 29th to production
expo and millennium skytrain service disrupted due to late night fire for updates
can i go to nanaimo stn by bus and take the skytrain from there to downtown
this might be simpler for people this morning
if you charge for a service and do not deliver then that is theft can i fine you for loss of wages due to your shit service
6 for the card and it doesn t even come with one fare loaded what gives expensive plastic and a money grab
a bus driver on bus s7466 on the 319 stop 55014 decided to stop at petrocan station to pick up a coffee from his wife
that fear when the skytrain randomly stops in between stations for a minute gt gt
drinking a pears in white satin imperial pear kolsch by at u2014
approx 7 55am today 240 15 st bus 9791 driver let so many people in the bus that a woman got her leg pinched in the door
do you want to take part of the this year
screenshot shows that i tapped at metro this am but system didn t register it as a tap out hopefully bus driver is nice
make a trip to load card on machine since online doesn t work 20 out of my bank account and no money on card how can this be
always a disappointment every day buses dont show on time at all more than 5 10min late or no show cliveden eb useless
why would i tap out if i need to use a second form of transit 2 mins after using the first one not paying another 2 75 no sir
thanks for the info the lady i bought it from was completely uninformed it s all good and my unnecessary rage is over ud83d ude09
hey why is the 159 to braid leaving early missed it 2days in a row by 2mins
has completely gone mad 5 fine just because you have a buy ticket at yvr vancouver
over 1hr wait at cliveden for 301 eb not the first time put in over a few cust complaints on this bus line no reply or action
where is the 10 bus have been waiting 20 mins at stop 50639
pretty inconsiderate when bus drivers take off when they clearly see people running to catch the bus we were right there
can i use fare saver tickets if i am going to the airport
am i really unobservant or did the faresaver validation machine at nanaimo station vanish do i do it with the new tvms now
why is the 19 holding at stanley park i ve been waiting at denman forever
i was waiting since 4 11 got on the 5 14
westcoast customer service is aweful and we pay how much per month for our passes
why don t u allow passengers board through all the doors thus speeding up boarding process you only need external door openers
just tried using a closed turnstyle at commerical stn holy crap it was slow and you expect ppl to wait patiently lol
defeats the purpose of fare evasion and a turnstyle
thanks but it s impossible when people work until 5pm
what is the deal with the 8 almost daily occurrence no bus from 5 30 to 6
but it s not a once a week it s 5 days a week the last 3 weeks can t one just move on that s what you do on the 3 in the am
well i sent a mail 2 weeks ago and got no reply appreciate you can t fix issue but please pass on to relevant dept
was doing us a favor by putting in no zone busing now i got a fucking seabus on the 240 every morning
the line for the 25 at ubc where is it
i have please fix coq central parking situation it s ridiculous open the exits
i m at langara 49th avenue skytrain station in vancouver bc
are there any 25 s eastbound on their way to stop 51500
hey let s touch knees now nsaid no one on a bus anywhere ever n translink n fetalposition
3 vancouver police officers checking fares for glad we live in such a safe city they aren t needed for anything important waste
seriously no bus 116 again stop 59740 nbeen here since 6 20
hey what s the point of having a bus schedule when they just come whenever they want and waste people s time step it up garbage
and of course they have guns cause u never know when u might have to cap some homeless guy that hasn t paid the 2 75
no shelter middle of no where industrial area 116 leaves stop 59740 early and leaves riders stranded
how come buses at nanaimo stn late and the train is stopped for some reason as well
is there anyway your company can get your act together we live in bc much less fortunate cities have vastly improved systems
wow line up at king edward and cambie goes around the corner time to increase amp improve this service nah
the 25 ubc at nanaimo station
just waited at a bus stop for over 40 minutes due to a bus delayed by 36 minutes translink you are a failure
when was the bus supposed to be here around 6 30 seems a little long to wait half hour
see on the bus halfway up the hill before the bus is due at that stop
discontinuing bus 4 and bus 7 will affect low income seniors that use this service everyday
only found out on a poster by concerned bus user of a survey even when i emailed if there was a survey emailed back no survey
again your bus are late what s new
if its due to traffic jams you need the city to post do not park at anytime along dundas 2 lanes will now be 3 lanes
yes i am aware but tomorrow is the last day the survey only up oct 16 til nov 6 that is not fair no notice any where
your agents at customer service told me there was no survey when i emailed them even the poor need service to get to work
i thought november 4th was yesterday
we ve traveled back in time marty
transit network consultation get involved by taking the survey by tomorrow 16 00
19 just skipped homer w pender stop everyone ran after it driver said software doesn t show the stop despite 19 being on sign
any track maintenance after tonight
i haven t been able to get real time transit info for the 188 for a real long time now any reason for that
i was at 59286 i got on that bus fine but wasn t getting real time info on a third party app
a c29 should come up now cause apparently its suppose to skip if no one s there
when looking up bus schedules what do the times with the little x next to them signify
that s probably a good idea also 33333 hasn t been replying when i ve texted it for next bus times anything on that
there s a guy amoking on the westbount platform of scott rd station
telus and it s not working at all tried multiple stops
could you start fining people for smoking in stations instead of just asking them to butt out they aren t getting the message
i m having prob w my card i paid full fee for nov but getting neg bal after x3 days and 2 two zone trips day help
why do we have to switch trains at columbia going westbound i missed a bus because of it
are bikes allowed on expo line at this hour thanks
yes i was on m line why the switch
your real time text service is the most unreliable piece of crap ever honestly people plan their schedules around it
how much longer is the power rail replacement going to take
how does a bus showing on the real time text service as arriving at a stop at 9 20 pm just never show up
thanks for the feedback not a starred time in this case will f u with cr
how can they enforce that law if they can t punish someone who refuses to stop
right and a materials breakdown curious how u201cgreen u201d they are recyclable or not
buses stopped wires down
don t you wish the skytrain had more switch tracks than it was built with
some day i believe the 49 will be on time some day
what is with these creepy eyes at lougheed skytrain
what is with the creepy eyes at lougheed skytrain lougheedeyes
i guess it does make for a good halloween scare the possessed signs are watching
do attendants not have a mandate to report system bugs i got a care free forget it no big deal then they kept chatting away
at least attendant tried to help your supervisor clearly didn t care even a simple i ll let someone know would have been nice
would be nice to at least be informed that it s going to take me 2 hours to get home lol
convenient isn t it more cuts and cancellations coming soon thanks to translink cmc audit needed
ff
translink_ni to extend 13 bus service from monday ninews
hi i need to be at gvs for 9 30am sunday going by journey planner that isn t possible with translink please confirm thnx
r u serious u really believe users can t handle the choice of having a phone app amp or a card lame
this is unacceptable 2 stations in row with elevator out i in a chair am now going to be late for work
this also happened to me last saturday get your shit together
i m at surrey central station in surrey bc
has a noise exposure assessment been undertaken on a mk 1 skytrain some trains seem v loud and could damage hearing
hello rr it s not the loudest one i have been on however if the exposure is about 30 min that could be over a noise threshold
what s up with expo lobe been waiting at scott rd for 5mins
hey guys what s going on with the c6 it s usually never late
323 derek best service best driver
yes 038 was fairly loud this morning but seems mid range in the noise dept
please ensure 17 drivers know about the stop change at bway amp oak driver stopped at regular stop passed by temp nowimlate
just saw it happen with the 9
it may help to have the temp sign moved higher for the drivers to see as well
it s pretty sad when the elderly lady has to get up so the pregnant lady can sit down getoffyourbutt
i left my bag on the 99 this morning is there a number i can call to make sure its brought to lost property
was a 135 sfu cancelled recently waited 15m for a bus to pass up my stop 51851
i think if the bus is full but 2 people get off you should let 2 people get on 59835
what times the last west coast train or train bus tonight
b9410 ran stop sign coming out of edmonds bus loop and then honked at me for coming out of drop off loop with no stop sign
okay thanks managed to get on the next one
i m using a once upass card does it make a difference
skytrain to surrey central hasnt shown up been waiting for 10 mins
not anymore but i have loaded money onto it since i graduated last month
why is the joyce station up escalator still under mtce doesn t look like any work done on it all week
so am i paying correctly what s the 1 75 then
transit network consultation get involved by taking the survey by 16 00 today
so any zone for bus but as long as i check in and out within the same zone for the sky train i m covered
so it s not actually 1 75 as your ad suggests
no east bound 44 buses this morning
last complaint i filed i selected response required and never got one always nice to feel heard joke
it s ok though good thing i enjoy standing in the cold and rain and being late for work
on the skytrain and everywhere else everyone i ve talked to has assumed it s 1 75 i think it could be a lot clearer
i know it s not much but the ads are quite misleading
is the 44 on schedule today i think the latest one traveling downtown did not show up
the 43 scheduled for stop 61281 at 8 56 never showed up
i m at yaletown roundhouse skytrain station in vancouver bc
i m at bus stop 50023 c21 c23 in vancouver bc
alma amp 4th av
that doesn t make sense as i got on the 8 54 i was scheduled to take the 8 44 but it never arrived
not being able to get on a double length bus is kinda ridiculous 15moreminutes commuterproblems
glad it s not just me has anyone done a noise survey
sending consecutive empty expo trains to columbia really makes for a way more crowded ride for everyone who needs a mil train
there was one but 6 min behind
i m only using the bus could it be the deposit 6 is empty i was not using it as a monthly pass originally
can t get tickets at langara canadaline station
no single day ticket option
no single trip ticket option
ya that screen was not showing up on either machine 1 was ood lots of ppl seemed confused
ya that screen was not showing up on either machine many others also seemed confused
would be helpful if you guys had people at every station during this transition
weird clicking sound on skytrain car 101 heading towards waterfront
vancouver bus beware of the current driver of the 25 v9506 westbound just at laurel stop no regard for safety translink
we d love to have your team at our digital pm workshop on 11 21 in vancouver details are here
if someone with a cane gets on regardless of their age please give your seat up if you u2019re able n translink transit
complaint sent via website but i m sure nothing will happen to this asshole who apparently thinks he s driving a sportscaster
complaint sent via website but i m sure nothing will happen to this asshole who apparently thinks he s driving a sportscar
that u2019s 2 days in more pain than i need to be because of people awkwardly avoiding me as opposed to moving n translink transit
i u2019m finished with being polite about it n translink transit
i almost forgot to tap out after getting off the seabus is there an app for the card i u2019ve only used my card on buses until now
last day to take the survey
oh i u2019m not going to get mean or anything but i may be a bit more vocal
hi ivan local transit authorities ie are the authority on bus stop standards
thanks is there the possibility of an app in the future
i think once the gates are closed it ll be unlikely to forget tapping out i ve been walking through the gates for ages
do you need to tap out of buses i ve been doing it this whole time so far
at the very least right
nothing about their uniform suggested transit police and why the guns if they are just interacting w public
when is the next bus going to arrive at 50206 thanks
a monthly pass gives unlimited travel in that zone why the need to tap in out what do you mean charged the correct fare
i ve been waiting for a while now also can i use my day pass it s one of those ones that need to go through those machines
that s apparently not the case for westcoast where they have more zones
where is the 49 ubc at metrotown
if i m traveling along the canada line stations along sea island do i need a special ticket for that purpose
un question pour vous are bus shelters supplied by the municipalities you guys probably don t pay for those right
merci have a lovely day
hi i m at lougheed waiting in rain for bus 555 to go to carvolth 12 42 never left and there s a 555 bus just sitting here
i got off the bus so ppl can get off too i was going to get on again but the driver closed the door and drove off wat ud83d ude10
is the 106 still going to stop 52404 been here 20 mins with no bus and others were here before that
thanks for your response the information you had offered had been useful
the number of pissed off people at my bus stop is incredible
yes thank you the driver told us about the accident too kept his cool despite probably being asked at every stop thanks
thank you so much for putting up a bus shelter at 56028
wow 49 bus soooo late
agreed then don t have police doing fare checks which was my original point
i already made it but the seniors been at the stop longer than me and i waited 1o 15 main 49
hey try using for your next survey support canadian entrepreneurs vs surveymonkey
finally reveals breakthrough 194 million ticket system for vancouver transit n skytrain
why is the 10 always so delayed 6 not in service buses in a row waiting 20 mins frustrating and cold
bus just arrived driver refused to open door until we knocked on it b c another bus was coming soon nice
is the 97 cancelled whats taking its place my daughter needs a bus from lougheed station tonight around midnight anything
transit network consultation get involved by taking the survey by 16 00 today
i love waiting 30 minutes to be given 4 options of 41 busses to board thanks
thanks tricky message i got will do survey thanks
404 bus not found
where s 188 at 59283 ppl have to get to work
yes please no next stop needed just the name let s take a page from on this one
well lets get and to remove redundant words like station
looks like some people will be missing trains and getting to work late if they have to go thru all that
so there is no 90 min window it s usable until end of service
i got on will this bus do 152 to lougheed next
thanks i ll have a look and for the record your social media management has always been impressive
what track maintenance tonight and upcoming
what time does the next 320 langley centre leave surrey central
big shoutout to 10 granville driver blowin past my wife amp baby clearly waiting for a ride and by shoutout i mean fuck you
the 123 brentwood from new west at 3 40pm is driving at a crawl of 15km through clear roads intersections this is ridiculous
seriously some of you 10 granville bus drivers need to learn how to do your jobs you are fucking ridiculous
so apparently no one tapped in using the mid or back doors on the 99 that i am on right now sad nodata
very unimpressed with the lack of communication to the residents on the rerouting of the 4 7 16 busses along van s northeast end
driver on bus 9767 made a clear detailed friendly anncm t about capilano detours with invite to ask if details needed kudos
i love it when drivers make the destination easier by being informative
thanks best believe i ll be making official complaints about this malarkey
thank you for the clarification and yes i ve already completed it i just wish there was more direct notice to the residents
took your advice amp emailed cr on 10 oct re this amp a similar second incident ignored me thanks for wasting my time translink
what is up w 152 4 50pm bus is always late or never shows 4 out of 5 days this week perhaps someone can look into more buses
where can i suggest bus lines
the elevators at sperling station have a terrible exhaust smell in them both sides
that doesn t help me right now during the afternoon commute this didn t happen in the beta
documented that s so helpful just awesome have you verified that or is this just conjecture
any reason service to queensburough is so spotty 104 is consistently late the 5 07 bus never even showed up today
22nd st station on a bus now can t tell if its a very late 5 07 bus or an on time 5 22
394 express service really does suck pi rain at king george and a no show bah
done feedback id 667399
thanks it happens fairly frequently with 104 it makes things difficult to plan when they don t run on time
laughable 2 show up bus1 won t leave for 20 then another arrives so we all get off and chase before bus2 leaves beertime
thanks jd any chance in future that next bus realtime will ever show bus running late by 10 mins
freezing turn heating on skytrain 304 heaters aren t even on
alright thanks a bunch will make sure i do if i encounter problems
would be great to know the bus was just over the hill esp if you are able to look it up forward this to nxtbus realtime
it s nice when the 44 bus blows right by the stop 50073 and doesn t pick up any of the 3 people here
haha forward the gps late running info to the nxtbus realtime site so we also see it what i meant thx all the same cheers
well over 100 ppl waiting for bus 2 tsawwassen ferry at bridgeport sure hope we don t miss it
where is the 5 49pm c28 at coq station i m fuckin freezing
thx but 6 00 pm now amp joyce stn escalator looks same as on monday ltd resources undrstd but platform access constrained already
thanks but i m home and still no heating lol hopefully for monday evening it will be running
is the 22 macdonald actually going to be at 51344 in 15 mins the time keeps changing
where is the 407 on steveston hwy and ransford is the most unreliable thing ever
bus was 10 minutes late stop taking people s money if u ain t gon na be on time boo
bus v9554 just skipped 2 19 stops in a row why
south vancouver hopes changes its mind about routes
i ve been waiting for almost 30 minutes for the 17 headed downtown i m at 64th and oak app shows the bus just sitting at marine
traffic is not bad enough for 3 buses to just be sitting still along the 17 route to downtown what is wrong waiting for 30 mins
definitely a change i wouldn t want to see could buses alternate instead
how far away is the 503 stop 55070 thanks
there was barely any traffic northbound on oak bus arrived 30 minutes late ud83d ude11
where are all the northbound 10 buses
50213 i ve been inhaling someone else s lung cancer for 20 minutes now
pt 2 u2026 i didn u2019t tap out somewhere u2026 problem is u2026 i definitely didn u2019t miss one today i am soooo pissed
the 6 00pm 316 surrey central bus from scottsdale didn t pick up customers and now the 388 6 32 bus from 61189 is delayed til 7pm
thanks i see them now ncan you guys do something about the smokers please
both buses that couldve helped me get home faster are both delayed this is unacceptable this is only surrey
i think we left around 25 people lots of construction on highway
i u2019m sorry u2026 but please explain to me how this can be so dificult after the massive gestation period it went through so sad
where are all the 100 22nd st buses i ve been at marine drive for almost 1 2 hour and seen 7 marpole buses but no 22nd st
addfare for stored value didn t cost what i thought it would i thought we saved money by having stored value charged 1 25 1 2
for crossing zones when i have a 1 zone bus pass i thought it would take off 1 05 not 1 25 confusing 2 2
at marine drive station four 100 to 22nd station eastbound in the last 15 mins no westbound buses
can u see why the next 10 westbound was just cancelled
just hopped a 17 westbound will walk from oak to granville thx for the info ud83d udc4d
thanks for responding not sure i m sold on the new system yet felt like i was mislead into believing it would save me money
under canadian law if i sign an agreement and money is exchanged it is a contract you can t ask me to pay you amp change your mind
i think twitter folks do an awesome job responding to people on twitter thank you for being there for us o yayfortransit
wait a second aren t the trolley wires on seymour being taken down i read all buses are re routed to granville until sunday
thank you i will i m not sure how often this happens but it s illegal i will contact them immediately to have it rectified
what time is the last expo line eastbound from granville tonight
yo guyss where is the 123 nw stn at waiting at canada way and willingdon its coldd
standing at 50425 the 209 just blew past a group of people because a police car was blocking the stop didn t bother to stop by
question monthly pass 1 zone if i go to metrotown before 6pm the additional fare is 1 25 correct
something wrong with your train announcements keep repeating 5 times in a row
yes skytrain this is a millennium line train to vcc clark 5 times in a row it s like she s rapping car 228
does anything happen when you forget to tap out
but it was too funny had a grin on my face lol thanks
cutting the 351 from white rock amp crescent beach is anti environmental and anti rider worker not cool
people who now walk half a block to the bus will have to walk 10 20 blocks
yep is cutting services all over they re assholes
yes i phoned today and they told me that it was to save money
drunk guy at 29th ave station not looking too good follow the vomit
but if you forget which i did it shouldn t matter i paid 130 for a pass this is stupid
yeah i have read that link you sent to me i still stand by what i said there isn t even a skytrain in 3 zones it s stupid
don t you worry my feedback will be sent
my mistake since i never go there as my taps can show you shouldn t just charge people 3 zones this is a new thing
if you want people to remember then you should be closing the gates i know exactly where i forgot to tap out airport
a station where people are constantly bumping in to each other easy to forget to tap out
the operative word seems to be yet n translink
in the end you ll only save your corporation a tiny bit of money while making life worse for many citizens
public transit shouldn t exist to make money for your corporation your ideals are askew
the 16 at stop 51037 still hasn t come 5 mins late updates
if it means you ll miss the portadown game you should be thanking translink
i hope realises that having two elevators in a row out makes wheelchair employees late for work if i lose my job their fault
maybe if focused less on a fare card that is failing miserably and more on their maintenance people wouldnt hate them so much
you d think could get the first bus of the day right but both the 5 20a and 5 35a 351 s are no shows at bridgeport pathetic
sounds like the brutish rail service
oops it apparently was a 545am which hopefully just pulled in finally freezing imnottheangriest
hey so u2026 the driver driving bus number 8134 didn u2019t stop at stop number 51469 drove right past u2026
me and onto the next one with me having to run for it this morning i don u2019t give a shit if i am not standing right next to u2026
bus stop when there is a sheltered area for me to stay dry a bus stop not to mention that it came 2 min early as well
what am i paying 91 dollars for a month so i can get to my destination using your transit system
this has to be the worst incident i u2019ve ever encountered
the fact that he didn u2019t even attempt to make the stop is what really pissed me off
and a small boat
i m so surprised that they ve done that it should be spaced out amongst stations
i left a backpack on the 351 brisgeport that just let me off at riverrock casino can you let the drive know for me 1 2
or know when it u2019s going to leave riverrock casino so i can run back and get it
it would have left king george and 2900 block at 7 22am
i was sitting at the front behind the driver it u2019s beside the single courtesy seat
my heading back now from marine drive realized then leaning in 2

110 lougheed 9343 has been stuck at lozel stop for almosr 5 minutes according to real time can i get confirmation its moving
if you re going to move a stop temporarily please advise your drivers so they don t blow past without stopping stop 59440
great to hear well don t translink

i m off the skytrain now sorry
logic let s cut the route so we can do less work smh
yup and buses were really early today missed one and ran to other one to open door he left 6min early smh
heckling a woman over 56 about purchasing a wrong ticket is ridiculous worst customer service ever on the seabus i contd
i understand that its part of the job but belittling someone wow just wow notimpressed horriblecustomerservice
heads up lots of walk on passengers on the 11 am ferry from swarts bay today hope they add extra buses to meet the demand
pt 1 u2026one other thing that they really need to consider u2026 zones are the problem most major cities don u2019t have multiple u2026
pt 2 u2026 zones within the city less dishonest people if we were not being u2018gamed u2019 by our own transit system
if u want peeps to take ur inconvenient transit then stop kicking people off with crying kids i will never use cause that s abuse
i saw this on the news the news has a big impack on the viewers such as myself hearing about stuff like that is very upsetting
i have kids and they can be a handful at times but if transit wants more peeps then it s something that has to be put up with
on a rainy day like this when a bus shows up the bus service feels like blessing and driver a angel lol thanks
so its bcferries to thank or translink for the 100 people left wanting due to the two busses being full
really fucking tired of wasting my time
we need more buses that runs 24 7 and trains that run 24 7
can your pa guys be a little louder please we can t hear any voices over the sound of squeaking skytracks
what was announcement 252 expo to waterfront
zipcars live near skytrain stops zip from amp more
i heard skytrain control
it was someone using live pa
nah i think the fellow was calling out to a certain group of people to meet somewhere but i couldn t hear it well
no i do not remember the bus number wither just that it was the 41 bus
ones near handydart bay
yeah thats against everything i have heard
whats going on with the tracks at the scott road platform the ones to king george sounds like someone s hitting it with a hammer
ok so still total epic fail by translink one ticket must work everywhere
one ticket to rule them all
one ticket to guide them
i yelled thank you when i got off the skytrain i thought i was still on a bus awkwardtransitproblems
99 hasn t suddenly magically been extended to boundary has it google maps seems to think so though
u201c habslions one ticket to rule them all u201d and one fare system for all systems
thanks so much for the speedy reply
apart from tweeting about it you should complain by email to belfast translink hq
please start posting when you have disruptions i look like an asshole again for being late skytrainfail

what happened to 8116 saw it sitting on the side this morning
have a read error on an unused faresaver validator was able to validate another unused one in my book thoughts
very pleased that has offered a way to text in the next bus route times during my stay in vancouver quite pleased
the example that has i e txt in next bus stop times should give my pals at an idea for their future system
i d like to know when you re planning on decommissioning these crap old mark i trains and getting new ones
what is the process of refurbishing an old train
when is the last train to king george
do you normally tell your drivers to block a busy intersection for 2 cycles of the lights
check ur skytrain hours before u wreck ur self
yes they do i have bought one and it tapped just fine
oh trains decide to open when they want on sundays now huh convenient thanks
in the station now the train is stopped 20 yards from the platform thanks
can you tell me if 49 westbound is on time was supposed to arrive at 49th st cath at 707 trying to catch ferry
now why do your bus drivers come so late
why does the 49 keep on getting later and later stop 51648
northside interior elevator not working at brentwood stn nostaff
maybe 50431 is no longer a bus stop since 211 failed to stop after making eye contact and being waved at
so what does stop here app doesn t give any bus lines for it ghost stop
different app trashing it now
ok this is really getting ridiculous when my bus is 10 min early
for tomorrow actually planning a new commute for a new job
still waiting for a response
it s just fyi
beautiful day to be in on my way to on seabus for late brunch
just noticed nanaimo station has a new shade of green ud83d ude02 ud83d udc4d
is there a 337 bus coming for 61677
caught eb mil line at 8 11 am from 22nd st where did it start there were eb trains running before that
i m having troubles reading trip history can you explain what s happening in these two journeys thanks

thank you what is the first eb train from edmonds on a sunday
c30 at coq stn
nvm i m on it lougheed and westwood though the traffic at that intersection is terrible
this is a joke i m at carvolth at the 501surrey central stop 2 busses haven t came and now when the bus came it changed to nis
changed to not in service i m now waiting for the 3rd bus almost an hour after i got here translink what the heck is going on
i just spoke to someone on the bus who told me the bus was running late and skipped the 501 stop let people off and kept going
and the same bus just came back you really need to fix this this is unacceptable
next 58089 times are
it appears to me that the greatest offenders of door blocking are transit staff
if i tap 6 20pm dt canada line and tap out at marine drive 6 35 then tap back in and go into richmond is that still 1 zone
watching a guy smoke on the train just pulled into 22nd street
it s out for the moment mustard jacket jeans runners older slightly out of it kinda guy columbia now
no worries have a good one
fyi he s on 256 now
when will the 129 go back to metrotown
3 days ago i was waiting an hour and a half for the 136 from production way university in 5 u00b0 weather and dropped my phone ud83d ude12
what s with the bus full when there s so much room left wouldn t be so bad if the 22 wasn t such bad service
thanks for sharing translink have a great sunday
sorry for not being more specific but i still have it i just dropped it out of my pocket while checking the time in the cold

1 2waiting at stop 53032 c38 supposed to come at 6 22 was running 10 min late c38 finally came went wrong way turning on
2 2 lions way minute later 2nd c38 drives by speeds right past the stop me and 2 other people waiting at so pissed
oh and the complaint line is closed because why would they want to provide customer service
perfectlensca i have seen your platform ad
what a friendly driver route 100 to 22nd station bus v9714 8 25pm
what happens if you forget to tap out
this was from way before but why didn t the bus come on the scheduled time which was 6 17 and 6 34
i believe it was 152 and the bus stop was 53401
drilling for the evergreenline at this time is not ok loud shaking awfulness
did the wind blow the 7b off course or is the driver finding it difficult to drive with both thumbs up his arse translink
no bike today i find using translink to work gets me so stressed out
yes thanks though i m now very late for work and will have to work late translink are a national embarrassment
aye translink i think the driver on 8am portadown to belfast stopped for a wee nap about 4 times between lisburn and belfast
might want to check out the wording on this document just some friendly advice from a teacher
is 3 at 50166 late
wce wb 3 delayed at maple meadows due to door issues now addressed but delayed 7min
doesn t look like your texting service is working right now for telus could you give me the schedule for the 129 52767 thanks
another unreliable trip to work with how frustrating when a city can t provide appropriate public transit accommodations 28
hey it would be great to know that the wce is running late before it s already 5 minutes late thxfor the announcement
came back from 3 weeks in flawless transit japan and first day back wce has delays lol ridiculous
fortunately i work a literal stone u2019s throw from waterfront station
it seems that cares more about making money for their corporate board than providing a needed service
just so u know there is a train on the vvc clark line that the one door isn u2019t opening for people to get on
text translink is slow today what s 57479
no i am not on it anymore and no sorry i didn u2019t see the number
it u2019s one of the old ones redone that u2019s now grey
61747 28 pulled up on time kicked everyone off if that happens i would expect a backup bus to be there immediately
late bus means rally car driving ud83d ude33 place your bets on 211 we re almost on time now ud83d ude31 ud83d ude8c u2604 u2604
is the 7 49 503 coming it s just sitting there
the inconsistency of the c29 bus in coquitlam is infuriating and has been for months just waited 45 mins for no bus why
please know that it s very annoying to have 2 passing busses that aren t in service then having a third bus show up full
58298 and coquitlam centre transfer spot and presumably others on this route drivers never share any reasons for this
there has been 5 buses that have arrived going the other direction of what i need within the 30 minutes i ve been waiting for my
bus but not a single available bus has arrived
a bus has already arrived but because of this i m late for my morning tutorial and may be late for my class as well
there was no 748 unless you mean the 810 as a result many missed wce connections driver offered no reasons
i m on a 25 brentwood
on my way to work king george skytrain station in surrey bc
thanks for follow up and i hope somebody can look into this no bus stopped and there were 5 8 of us there
bus 20 2504 marked bus full with lots of room in the back nice try
555 w hastings harbour centre is having a full e vac fire drill at 09 20 till 09 45 just a heads up that streets may be busy
shout out to my fam for doing fare checks when there is a huge rush and for bus drivers not waiting 2 seconds to leave ud83d udc38 u2615
i think a new marketing campaign about moving to the back of the bus would be awesome
considering this bus route is notoriously busy maybe bus drivers should pay more attention and not skip stops at rush hour
does the 16 2289 driver really need to stop for his tea break at 8 56 every day makes a whole bus late for work amp school
can u use it as a monthly bus pass for zone 1
that was quick brentwood town centre skytrain station in burnaby bc
when are you going to create an app
why did the 28 bus at 9 11am to capu didn t pick up anyone why why why the bus driver just drove past everyone waiting ud83d ude30 ud83d ude24
there was nobody in the bus it s the first stop 51722
for android and iphone something that i can open quickly to check bus schedules and route plans i kow you have a mobile site
i ride that bus everyday to school
the 9 11am bus everyone in the bus stop were mad and frustrated they re late for school for work
a woman already called the translink supervisor and reported it
is the texting service not working my cell provider is koodo and i am not receiving any time back for stop 59518
seriously is someone sabotaging the escalators at main st skytrain station they are rarely operational whatsupwiththat
you need to through for this journey as they operate services in northern ireland
do you know yet what was going on at lougheed with the loud ringing
hi i ve asked before but there are strange eyes on the screen lougheed any chance of removing them

any idea if wind will be likely to effect skytain service this evening
thanks for sharing translink bc have a great thursday insight by
stop at 228th i think it s 52175 there is construction going on no signs construction

i have a monthly pass 2 zones it deducts 1 50 then returns 1 50 when i travel the addfare before after 6 30 makes sense

at least i ve been remembering to tap out
the 3 05 19 isn t very nice esp with this weather it left me behind amp left the stanley park loop early all i need was 60 secs
9s heading westbound from boundary is about 10 minutes behinds schedule just letting you guys know
tjmair the honour system is a bad way to run a business also i can load a pass from my phone lost stolen pass protection
i lost my bag on the 99 last week and it still hasn t showed up at lost property any chance of reviewing the security cameras

i m on the bus now thank u wet windy night
hey any word on the 104 the 5 07 is late people have been waiting at 22nd st since 4 30 and no 104s come through
what time does the 402 403 come at bus stop number 56542 i get off work at 6 00pm and i was wondering if it comes at 6 02
give this guy a raise his stress is through the roof
any word on when the 19 will travel down pender st again
your 101 bus towards lougheed is leaking raindrops in the back
this is why buses are late vancouver traffic
sometimes people allowed on 7 if arrives early other times make old people wait in the freezing rain any reason
car 241 on skytrain is leaking water from the roof onto the seats
you ve got to love the bus driver that doesn t let you board early in this weather
not sure we re near royal centre now
buses ignore me on purpose so many times since october even when i was right by the stop it made me late for school all the time
surrey crews are on scene with a pedestrian struck by a transit bus at 104 ave amp university dr
dear any way you could not blast the heat on the skytrain had to get off this am after becoming dizzy having 2 stand thanks
waiting 40 minutes for the 144 sfu really
i will miss you everyone because i m leaving to usa
is the 354 352 running late from bridgeport stop 61329
when is the 19 to stanley park supposed to come to granville and west pender it is very late
how can the 104 be less efficient driver on the 5 37pm can t follow a simple detour sign good thing a teenager shows him how
not seeing it
is the 240 going towards north van delayed i ll be at stop 61031
what about the 241 is that the same situation
hi waiting at 50078 and the 211 just drove right by then proceeded to go through a red light maybe you re overworking them
how about adding solar powered lights to top of stop posts a for safety b so we don t have to do that
unfortunately when there s no bus shelter driving rain bus riders wait under shelter elsewhere amp drivers don t stop 50935
i wouldn t suggest running out in front of the bus so the driver avoids hitting you last night crazy people
i think the hope is they have peripheral vision and can see a lit cellphone at the side of the road
where s the 430 that s supposed to be leaving 61325 at 619
if the driver can t see a person how the hell can your driver see a small cellphone
the 144 at metrotown is absolutely never here for its scheduled 18 15 stop what s up with that now just waiting for the 18 35
it s the light that they see not your tweets and facebook status
ok thanks i got on the 241
they need to specify a cellphone that is turned on with active lighted screen vague
there s the frame of a shelter but no glass it s been like that for 2 years
no 008 at fraser 41st for 30 minutes
it seemed pretty straightforward to me
no 405 bus for more than 60 mins now this is ridiculous
144 bus just dropped people off now driver taking a break meanwhile there s a lineup of people who have been waiting for 40mins
guess i missed something good on ya
remarkably some people me have to get to a job and will be late
where can i complain ud83d ude2b i only catch this bus once a week and it s always late ud83d ude14
what happened to the 104 departing at 1824 from 22nd we were waiting since 1815
everyone in line is pissed and the driver is likely to get an earful
yeah 10 minutes later than the next scheduled bus this is extraordinarily bad form no amount of apologies will suffice
i know how to check bus timings thanksnothanks
it appears that every other route out of metrotown has been serviced multiple since we started waiting for the 144
yes and thank you for updating me
it appears that every other route out of metrotown has been serviced multiple times since we started waiting for the 144
any idea where the c28 is hasn t got to port moody yet
and to make it worse empty nos buses keep leaving and the 144 is only just pulling up to load
i waited 30 mins in the pouring rain with the wind constantly blowing just to see two 17 downtown s come by late really
light it up
ah 405 finally arrives phew i thought u forgot u service this route
will be new to using wce how often is it late arrives wf 6 40am must be there by 6 50 can i rely on it
the side coming out into the bay corridor leading up to granville street
although i mentioned to my husband and he was also confused lol
what happened to the 7 05 129 bus that was supposed to be at 58343 thanks
why all the nagging on the readerboards just show the time till the next trains
is there a way to tell if the next 335 from surrey central is a guildford bus or a newton exchange bus
throughout the day is there a way to tell through text which bus will be guildford or newton exchange the pole doesn t specify
agreed there should be no penalty until the gates are actually closed
thank you driver passengers on 14 that left ubc at 7 04 who returned my wallet and k who gave me a ride in the rain to catch them
it doesn t specify unless the represents something
good tip permission to try it with a lighter bonus it keeps you warm
tried to tap but didn t work and was running to catch train
officer also didn t have me sign ticket so i ll be disputing as its not fully filled out
wondering when the next 128 braid station bus will leave 22nd street skytrain first it said 8 27 then 8 37 now 8 57
what u2019s an exit ticket
it u2019s pouring rain and i u2019m so glad people u2019s bags need seats those bags must be so cold and tired gosh how nice for them
will hold the 9 12pm bus from tsawwassen until after you make the decision at 9 30pm
kissarisssa we will contact to advise as soon as we have a confirmed departure time from swartzbay rd
interesting i wondered about that as i exited tonight
you act like i care nyou re funny
they said they have notified you just don t want to skip the 9 12pm bus have the ferry cancelled and wait until 11pm
i am at tsawwassen concerned about getting home if it is cancelled
not in this weather
and i wasn t complaining using twitter to get information 2 make an informed decision b c both amp are helpful
it is boarding i did make it thanks
needs to talk to the driver of 211 that left burrard station at 18 12 today for driving past me at stop 50078
like i said i was right by the stops can t think of a way to be more visible and to be honest you don t reply complains at all
is it still possible to buy faresaver books of tickets adult one zone 10
would also make things easier for everyone if people wouldn t wear all dark clothing amp be alert
the bus driver tell me calling takes very long to get through got it fixed at stadium and two train rides later same problem
so i guess i will go back to stadium again tomorrow eye roll i was told issues were rare but doesn t seem like it
good to hear carissa we ve notified of our arrival time enjoy your sailing rd
thankfully i only have to worry about my mother being awake to get home from swartz bay ud83d ude09
also how dumb is it to use an escalator as a relationship model they u2019re broken half the time
so the power line replacement is over and now you decide to replace running rails do you really hate night shift workers
just wondering which station in the 1st of the 2 emails in screenshot
tapping out would be easier to remember if the gates were closed but i lived in a city with that system so it s not hard for me
all bus stops at scott road station
not concerned about fare gates one zone bus gal concerned about deposit and accuracy errors
i don t like giving away money for nothing in return ie deposit
refundable in vancouver nothing in valley so needs 3 zone ticket to get deposit back irony illogical i feel bad for poor
or can you email the form in
haha then i ve lost 1 from deposit i ll stick with tickets i bus 4 enviro t but feel bad 4 needy who can t give s 4 nothing
damn bus driver drives 20km the entire way no traffic in site yet can t speed up not like i have to be at work on time
ff
always irritating to see buses waitng for more than 5 minutes past their departure time at the previous stop
translink ni app will not update is there a problem with it
cheers don t listen to he s to much time on his hands unlike you hard working translink staff keeps up good work
hey is the 156 just running late or has it been cancelled
is the 33 bus being rerouted for the victoria drive stop headed to ubc there s an accident at 33rd and gladstone st
hey any idea why an almost empty 4 to ubc just passed by a stop with about 10 people waiting for it blenheim and 4th
the 10 29am 340 bus at scottsdale towards 22nd st still hadn t showed
probably they something vancouverites get high in on hightrain
they probably think it s something people from vancouver get high on in hightrain
i was wandering why 311 from bridgeport did not show up for last two days at 3 40pm passengers were so disappointed frustrating
can use two zone tickets if i am travelling on buses and not using the sky train
your c23 is such a joke put a real bus on that route
needs to have a fucking chat with their 10 granville bus drivers about stopping at stops amp letting folks get out the back doors
fuck you for skipping a bus waiting for the 101 for 1 hour now ughhhhh
doesn t translink advise buying a 3 zone ticket from a bus driver so how does that ticket get me through closed gates
i was waiting at lougheed station since 10 40am and finally got on at 11 36 fckn ridiculous could ve went to 22nd for 11 17 bus
there is an unpleasant civilian trolling your tweets and making your customers even more unhappy
a quiet bus train 1xhr would be marvelous no babies no talking no headphones phones muted etc transitsonoisylately
is the 791 at braid the bus with the medical emergency
yesterday 4 00 pm at new westminster station scbctaps nvideo must be retained without delay
dear not 1 zone fare for everything n nsincerely na disgruntled passenger ud83d ude21
pt fact of the day public transport performance snapshots now located at new url gt ptfact
any idea why 26 from joyce still hasn t left was supposed to leave at 1 32 according to when i texted the bus
yeah pulled up at 1 35 and left at 1 39 guess just running late but it s left now
so why is there a 49 westbound outside of langara station with no driver

congratulations to for receiving the next generation of skytrain vehicles and the future for surreybc

the stop is the one at bridgeport station the 311 bus was supposed to be here at 3 40
ugh 2 ppl drinking beer on skytrain ud83d ude12
wce train 1 delayed to surprise surprise a freight train in front of us wow so uncommon
fyi someone broke your next bus reader board at stop 50178
u just waste people s time 311 bus didnt show up 3 days 3 40 from b port why dont u put a notice is this how u promote transit
wce conductor announced that train 1 will probably be about 15 late into port moody freight congestion
do you think the escalator will ever get fixed at main street expensive set of staira
train 231 needs ac please expo to kg
that s great news thanks for letting me know
extremely disappointed with the service that was just demonstrated outside a bus this driver was not nice
there no point i can use the 160 to travel where i have to go and saves me money
seriously a 23 minute wait for the next 410 during rush hour did i mention it s 10 minutes late too getyourshittogether
why isn t my auto load working i have 0 after signing up for lt 5 10 auto load
driver of 99 b line bus b8109 just about ran me over while i was in crosswalk on broadway where bus starts near commercial
it took 33 minutes exactly for another 410 to get to a main stop during a high traffic time wtf notok getyourshittogether
hey is it another every 337 is broken down day again for the second week in a row
please install a bus stop bench on annacis island at chester amp derwent way people keep tipping over the newspaper stand to sit
what i hate about trains are the lack of bars and hanging handles especially on the canada line japan does it right
3minutes after the bus arrived 2 other 410 came at the same time that were almost empty amp passed my bus that is now over packed
c94 s527 just passed up stop 56444 when empty
bus s7353 the metal box under the raised seat near rear door is disconnected scraped my leg pretty bad should fix
if i start on a bus and have to travel 3 zones ie switch to skytrain then i have to pay bus fare 3 zone fare at skytrain
hey i m at 52230 did i miss the bus or was the bus cancelled there s been a lineup prior to 5 41
stop 52402 no 106 bus shows up in both sides of kingsway
hey why has skytrain gotten so loud recently between edmonds amp newwest constant howl like a siren
bus driver walked by me twice looking for it and ignored me when i tried to get his attention off bus now that was right number
thank you very much have a good evening
raised seat may have confused and caused him to look in back meant the seats directly across from the door that are higher
yes done so again thank you for the link
wound shot now that i can check whoops thanks for looking into it i shall survive
how to make vancouver transit better a public lynching would be a good start

nicest bus driver ever main 03 2540 chatty and greeted everyone thanks driver translink needs more drivers like you
pretty sure they are mostly 1k surveillance cameras with three weeks rentention
don t mention the facial recognition algorithms developed for identifying athletes in olympic video clips
i am not a student and i do have to pay double bc previously i was only paying for zones not methods of transportation
if we take a bus to wce station is the bus fare included in wce monthly pass
so when are those fare gates going to function forgot to tap out and drove back to the station to avoid a 3 zone charge fail
what does this mean
are these the refurbished mark1 cars or something new

what does ptz mean i see it everywhere along skytrain guideway
what does ptz and re mean i see them everywhere along skytrain guideway
translink what does ptz and re mean i see them everywhere along skytrain guideway
does the driver just idle at stops cause i would understand if it were super packed and busy but that s rarely ever the case
then why haven t they i complained a lot already yet nothing seems to be getting done about it doesn t seem like they care
y u no answer my question what does ptz and re mean i see them everywhere along skytrain guideway
it showed up on the correct sb platform anyway sign may need updating no staff in sight

i was just passed by a bus on the 25 with lots of room and i can see from real time updates that the next bus is not close
25 bus drivers aren t making full use of the capacity available and it is badly needed
has there been sched changes to bus 50 it s been leaving early from waterfront all week
why is your alerts amp advisories showing operating normally yet clearly you ve had issues today
the 9 bus that just passed stop 50850 wouldn t let us on amp it was only half full didn t even bother telling ppl to move back
it s colder on the skytrain than it is outside u26c4 ufe0f
58089 still not here what s going on
why is the 803 cancelled some of us rely on that 803 bus unreal
no 0800 228 from the quay for the second time in six days poor service
neither of the 2 buses displayed not in service yesterday a third bus had passed by mins later which was not in service
appreciate your reply and i hope you this helps you fix logistical inconsistencies
hello in metro vancouver the transit system is run by we run transit across the province except in yvr

hey how do you make a bus stop at the bus stop 2 flew past at 50496 amp i m standing under the bus stop sign fail freezing
you got to make your customers on this route aware a lot of angry people around me very unreliable getthisaddressed
first the 7 was late then driver makes us later while he gets a coffee then drives like a madman making people fall
without fail finds a way to ruin my morning and day thanks for providing such crappy service day after day
214 bus in the morning going downtown always forgets to stop at main and east hastings tell them to wake up
the 8 30 22 at 51277 is a no show why am i not surprised the ever reliable waited ten minutes prior to arrive wasted morning
that s fine and all but just letting you know that there were only 7 8 ppl standing w plenty of room left and he just drove off
complaint to cs submitted feedback id 661250 but wrong email in the form can you tell them my email should be all lower case

its staggering how every day your service is utterly terrible
leave me out of your inane vendetta against dude
what ya talking about hoping they would fav or retweet
your c26 s446 is in desperate need of repair and the driver doesn t seem to realize there s some abnormal smoke and exhaust rn
hey is there a rationale for 25 minute scheduled service so a on the 49wb during rush hour
road it s exhausting from in front of the left rear tire instead of the pipe and smells horrendous
i must have misunderstood the machine because it looked as though i could only get a day pass or add value to existing card

some of your staff at comm bdwy station are mistakenly telling people that they need add fares right now on monthly passes
thank you for explaining that la my favorite translink person
41st driver at 6 30 pm refused to stop 4 times leaving female alone in dark and rain unacceptable
no someone with valid monthly pass being directed by fare checkers to old machines to buy add fare
yeah it was odd you guys usually rotate them

i m in the bus stop 55165 waiting for the bus 620 at 9 14pm it s late and the driver didn t stop here why the bus wasn t full
translink thank you for not sending another 160 to vancouver and telling us it s a dead bus that comes every 30 mins
i m at renfrew skytrain how can i get to sapperton with the maintenance
my phone actually works to text 33333 yay love you guys thanks so much
so is the bus sitting there not working the bus driver sat on that bus chatting with his friend while we waited there 20 mins
the sms showed 9 14 and it was on time only didn t stop
what s going on at lougheed
that s fine but the driver should have communicated this 2 us so we can find an alternative route instead of just driving past us
time to crack down
are skytrains not going to braid i was on a waterfront train and it just started moving backwards after it went to lougheed
i ve seen too many gas scooters on the ptmann bike way
so how does it work if you have a one zone pass for normal use but then need to go to another zone from time to time
i boarded at commercial are there skytrains going to braid
rail grinding sounds like a skateboarding term or something far more dirty also will the new skytrain cars be quieter

that rail grinder is painfully loud
on one now thanks just one listed as arriving never showed thanks
it u2019s so obvious you u2019ll hear and where power rail has not been replaced the noise suddenly stops weird
when will the 2 years of track maintenance be done
that s disappointing mline passengers have been dealing w power rail for 2 years knowing an end date would be helpful
it s always congested and we pay a lot of money to use translink services not really a great outcome
fucking cunts hope ur business fucking dies u autistic cunts

busporn transitporn
u2026over the past 2 years countless time w emails to translink now i ve had the person at customer service hang up on me when
sorry missed that one what about the one after
u2026 asking for a supervisor cyclists have never been refused entry to the seabus no matter how many bikes if there is room
to have a customer service person state you complain about no sign amp i ll report more bikes on seabus than 8 is oxymoronic
we need folks out of cars the stanley park causeway is not the safest for cyclists and more are using seabus like myself
not the best but you get idea

hey city of and smoking at 8st 4ave bus stops again where s a guy with allergies sit when it s raining
so if the crowded 99 breaks down amp everyone has to get off amp walk to clark dr are you sending a completely empty bus our way
because i think you should since there s no way we ll all fit onto a bus that is already going to be full when it gets here
should riders expect express buses to only stop when someone is at the stop s signpost
and we re already late now and can t afford to wait 3 buses to get on

trolley bus 2173 running route 14 has virtually unreadable front sign driver indifferent to problem so reporting it here
i have been told the 10am 620 bus from tsa ferry terminal has been cancelled again is this true what are gulf islanders to do
and no plans to cancel in the future
it looks like the time will be changed from 10am to 10 55pm in the fall on your website
so passengers from the gulf islands sailing who i guess don t count towards ridership will have to wait until 10 55am
does this seem right to you the gulf islands ferry gets in at 9 20am
do you realize this makes a day trip for islanders nearly impossible many come in for doctors and specialists appointments
last year you tried to do the same thing
it was 51374 the 9 24 pm 22
esstbound skytrain approaching broadway commercial there are some tree branches hanging over track and brushing against the train

did the bus at stop 51939 leave before its scheduled time or did it get cancelled thanks
my stop on translink app isn t working there are at least 3 buses scheduled for the next 20 mins
175 on time and bus driver is as friendly as a bus driver can be r r translink
any ideas about the 112 new west bus that was leaving edmonds at 2 30pm hasn t shown up
so many cool local neighbourhoods to visit while in vancouver such as take
yes it was 10 mins late is all
guess the 211 leaving vancouver isn t a priority feels like close to half hour been standing here here 5min before scheduled
why are there even bus stops if the 620 driver is going to drive right past them miss my stop amp ignores me yelling stop plz
it s ok it s not your fault i m sure it was a mistake on his part so i won t file a complaint
ten years ago there was plenty of space shows the uptake in cycling all stations the same step up
since wce trains can t run on time maybe change the bus schedules so we re not always stranded in poco fedup
getting a little tired of making that announcement we re definitely tired of hearing it time to solve the problem
what s this 177 planet ice bus name looks very groovy
wce train 1 arrives poco 15 minutes late because of the cpr all together now boooooooooooo
u pass riders should not be ahead of full fare paying riders should def not be ahead of wce riders
is this problem expected to screw up the remaining trains yet again
so basically wce riders should never ever have appointments or plans because we never arrive on time anymore amp buses don t wait
if people could easily take their dogs on there wouldn t be a need just hop the bus to the dog park
hay good news train 1 is only 14 minute late into maple meadows

why do you think they are poor managers when they are one of the most fiscally efficient transit operators around
i heard about a job opportunity of cleaning busses a friend who knows a bus driver told me about it how do i go about that
i already called 911 but beware there s a man on a yellow bike at patterson screaming racial slurs at them

stadium is a flood of people got on a packed eastbound train 9pm may be too early to start trackwork based on of passengers

train 2 just now got to maple meadows
when we pay over 200 a month each you would think the trains would be kept up with maintanence so this doesn t happen
train 1 2 just left maple meadows train 3 10 minutes behind it
35min late at this point we just boarded
i figure someone should attempt to give accurate updates
it s all good ud83d udca9 happens ud83d ude04

hi andee passing the suggestion to this is what vancouver needs free late night transit on fri sat
teaser no mt is grossly inefficient 10th in my series
there are heavy costs of administration that needs looking into
public transport too costly for short distance rider
any solution to crazy fellow passenger who starts shouting and cussing ppl besides enduring it this morning was bad on 99 b line
pretty sure driver heard her a poor girl sounded traumatized after asking the lady to stop and the lady cussed at her instead
i ll keep the number in mind does the transit police do anything after the fact though
right i don t expect the driver to confront but was thinking if there were solutions cause there were no yellow alarm strips
ok hope it isn t regular thou cause i m starting to use transit more often thanks

6 trains to waterfront and not one stopping at stadium going the other way kind of crazy for a major transit system

is there any way to ensure the 97 uses artic buses during certain runs at newport ungless every single community shuttle drops
off between 7 55 and 8 05 only one 97 comes during that time when it s a conventional it s packed mostly school kids
bus can never pick anyone up after that stop until the school kids get off seems incredibly inefficient
i ve got a guy sitting beside me on 99 bus b8046 drinking a can of beer at 8 am personally i prefer a coffee or tea
wow all 4 escalators vancouver seabus station out of order at once impressive
the ticket machine at the east entrance of joyce station is taking money but not giving tickets

waiting for 375 guildford 152 and 84 ave its 6 minutes late this bus is unreliable ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12
i m at the carvolth bus exchange and there are no ticket machines this is a major hub are you trying to make this inconvenient
if you live in the burbs you re the one draining s cash a new data project from
are monthly west coast express passes transferable to all other means of transit on all days
so it s pretty much a 3 zone monthly pass with west coast express privileges
if you live in the towers are you the ones wrecking havoc on traffic and infrastructure costs balance
that may be true but theres 100 times more of them even if they they drive 50 less 50 x more cars
could be as much as 90 less
i dispute your numbers but either way 90 less on a 100 increase is 10 more but 90 wrong
i always forget what the first half of that art piece is and where it is in the station
what is real time next bus is it the technology to speak up the next stop while we are on the bus

if your trip planner was useful i would but since it is extremely slow and doesn t use the phones gps it isn t worth using
it is possible it broke on their end but far more likely it was broken by an update on your end escalate to your tier 2 support
yes except that function is lacking in maybe get them to integrate that function into the planner
so in order to use the system to plan my trip i either need to know the stop or load two unrelated pages handy
how is implement basic functionality a suggestion and not a feature requirement to your design team

what s going on with the 405 i texted at the stop 56451 and they seem to be delayed by half an hour thanks
the bus is always late at stop 52075 at this time of day what is the point of having a schedule
waited 40mins and only one main bus passed by fyi
i understand some delays but a lot of people rely on transit there should be some back up plans for big accidents
on the 99b line e right now at 5 50pm n bus driver is speeding and driving like a maniac passing glen n brdwy firehim unsafe
i am right now through twitter he s speeding and hard braking flew people in the back across the floor
here is the bus and driver eating on the bus after dropoff
hey are there no nvan busses going along pender today stop 50078
yup called and on hold for ten minutes and hung up translink nohelp
oh your 3 detour downtown is a huge pain
amp apparently new west burnaby buses r experiencing 20min delays for absolutely no reason at all edmonds is empty where da buses
i d love to support you but when you re late useless jerks more often than you re on time and helpful it s pretty fucking hard
extremely regretting my decision to take waiting centuries at each stop
hey both the 6 03 and now the 6 19 351 buses have not show up at stop 56081 what s the problem
ya bullshit 23 minutes with no 106 but good try and one finally showed up the one that was only 10mins late blocked in the
i am on the bus and it waits forever at each stop
one that was 20mins late so those of us at the front of the line got screwed even harder pathetic i leave one bus earlier
where s the number 10 50095
than i should have to every single day and still end up late more often than i m on time i should be 15min early
are you kidding i paid extra for a 2 zone pass that will now expire before i even get to my location and was not necessary
love these ac buses on the 49th street route translink
at least was accurate
hey are there any 016s running been waiting at renfrew and hastings for half an hour
yo where the guys you fired in charge of planning the detours around the gastown grand prix goodwork
i ve been waiting for the 135 for over half a an hour at sfu when are they coming how frequent are they today
is the 33 running on time waiting at 61095
is the number 4 stopping at stop 50035
don t see on alerts page maybe i missed it has this cleared thx
did the 145 to sfu leave really early currently 20 min till next one
hey guys wheres the 351 thats supposed to be leaving from 58274 now dont see it on the map s
great doesnt help but thats great
so now is able to ccomine jobs and fire useless employees what else can they do now translink bcpoli vancouver
what s going on with the 325 that should have left newton exchange at 7 27
what is the status with 135 i m seeing a 30 min wait for next bus normally 15 mins
burrard stop the queues everywhere is massive walked here so i can get on bus
stopthenoise at skytrain stations columbia station needs a roof to keep the announcements from bothering neighbours
any word what s going on with the 301 brighouse it was supposed to leave netwon bus loop at 19 37
i see the bus thank u but a lot of ppl waiting at other stops will likely be passed due to an already filled bus
what s the point of the that nothing will happen or change
when is the 135 sfu going to arrive at granville the line up is getting really long
what s going on with the 320 from surrey centre to langley centre the 7 49pm never showed up
but it never has amp it would just be more of a waste of time thanks anyways i know you are trying to help amp do your job
happy day ud83d ude01 with jtl at pic u2014
delays on the 3 and 8 are ridiculous right now it took an hour from hastings to broadway why do i pay for this again
no problem a guy just came and closed it thanks
214 vancouver at 7 57 isn t cancelled for tomorrow right no bad surprises
addfare for shopping at the new outlets i thought this was only for travelers arriving at yvr
reminder about what you can do in govt to make translink better for all qlders
new to van caught 250 van from park royal had wrong pass only z1 got a gay remark from driver of bus 801 at roughly 4 pm today
transit security were handing out fare evasion fines to fare evaders on the bus i was on today it was awesome
translink beside the payment kiosk templeton would ve been nice to know before i went will def deter me from taking canada line there
a nice bus ride home turned into a maze trying to find where made the 3 go thanks for the non informative signage
been waiting over 20 minutes
ah thanks just had a 50 pick me up and take me to the right stop really bad signage at seymour cordova be more specific
sign literally said 3 8 etc go to hastings nothing else tons of people waiting at the wrong stop for bus that won t come
the gps map view function is great for checking if that bus that flew past was the one you were trying for
in this case the bus that flew past was the one coming before the one i wanted so i knew to wait for the one coming next
this was a guy let on robson bus without paying
its a universal truth that if you re walking perpendicular to the stop you ll see a bus pass you before you get to the stop
blocking the aisles not a safety issue
someone just got on the back food of the 135 stopped at brentwood with a dog and i can t get up tell the driver
130 to kootenay loop
they just got off at hastings
50035 is no 8 coming
why the info is different you wasting all the people time
they inform riders to go to stops that lead to other stops eventually leading to pender street where the 3 didn t pass at all
do you know what time does the 22 mcdonald bus comes at knight st bridge
zoe translink staff are hopeless
thanks i see the bus right now and thanks again and have a good night as well
when does the last skytrain heading west towards waterfront station leave metrotown on weekdays thanks
let s talk would love to do trafficjam in vancity too
just wondering if the 312 is coming i m at stop 54897 and it s 10 mins late now
quick question if you re a student can you use an adult 1 zone faresaver 2 75 1 to somehow make a student 3 zone ticket
thanks for the heads up i just got on it appreciate the response though
translink i m the skytrain
nyou re my fuckpuppy you hot gay slut
i made love on that train
while listening to on i think follows the british rail model freyburg
one machine out of service and another won t take debit cards had to go take out cash please fix gateway 2nd level
some bus drivers are liars amp assholes a bus driver told me i could buy a bus ticket at a gas station but they don t sell them
said driver sees me get on his bus regularly told him i lost my tickets amp only had enough cash on me for a 1 zone
there wasn t any confusion he knew chevron doesn t sell bus tickets i know which stores sell bus tickets he s just a liar
told him i lost my tickets only had enough cash to buy a 1 zone asked if i could upgrade bridgeport told me to buy chevron
so if i m 17 and i still have my high school go card can i get tickets in one zone
i ride his bus regularly he is always crabby always
another day another bus that doesn t show on time getting sick of and the shitty service wtf am i paying for fire them all
maybe if fired every executive we d have a decent service but they are to incompetent for even that is a joke
soiled seat on skytrain 206 heading downtown at 22nd st
as normal with shitty i ll spend more time waiting for a late bus then i do on it shitty service what they do best
wtf is the 7 bus at stop 58125 ngetting sick of waiting
beside the rear door on the south side where no one will sit at royal oak now
yep it is now with a 2nd behind it really need to keep on schedule bus is late more often then it s on time
if this bus is late and has a other bus behind it why does it continue to pick up new passengers should be an express us now
bus is late with a 2nd behind it yet it continues to pick up new passengers making it even later great job we like bad service
how does the bus behind get full if the bus in front is picking up everyone your logic makes no sense this route is not busy
the c23 that was supposed to be at stop 59991 about ten minutes ago has never showed what gives
your reduced summer runs for the 351 during rush hour is poorly thought out buses packed every morning to the rim
what happened to the nb number 3 at 9 29 and 9 34
50174 how long will this be an issue
is the number 8 bus running it s normal route out of downtown today there was a detour yesterday
is the 143 at coq station delayed
and must be run my the same people two of the worst companies to deal with as a guest in the entire country
yeah i ended up taking the canadaline down but i was just wondering if the issue would still be there tomorrow
hey is it a new policy to ask every seabus traveller to see their ticket now or is this just a temporary measure
touched by the fierceness of the riders of 19 today in kicking out a guy spewing racist shit on noracismontransit
what s the stat on the 155 to 22nd bus stop 53613 10 07 one didn t come
another example of drivers blocking the intersection willingdon and beresford in burnaby jerks
to get to bc place for tomorrow can i take these routes or is there a different route
yes one direction thank you so much
would love counts from traffic light induction loops too

icymi monthly passholders call offer after skytrain shutdown useless
take a seat as translink sticks it to you one more time
both up escalators at dunsmuir exit of granville are off or under construction but a down one is working thx for the workout
well it s better than a kick in the face at least
i think we need another pet peeve animal scaredy stairs 3rd time this week a bus is full b c riders don t go up the back step
they are fare gates that were not certified for use in canada they are never used can not even read the tickets
all fare validators but one at main station are out and the one that worked gave me a write error

if you claim the wce to be a fast train what do you consider the ice tgv agv or shinkansen to be
tnx for letting me know im just worried i m going to miss my transfer bus to richmond
tap on off machines should be installed at bus stops there s a risk of rush hour delay when a ton of commuters need to tap off
i am confused do we mail the orig monthly pass or is photocopy accepted for pass replacement
translink should have done more user experience testing have they never gone to disneyland now that is an ultra awesome tap ux
351 is over 20 minutes at stop 55388 what s the issue
translink my last two tweets might sound pedantic but ux is huge when you re changing the way millions of people use public transit
thanks all good i was able to validate at a later station
you can please some of the people some of the time except in vancouver where no one can please anyone smile
thanks i got some info from someone who got theirs done yesterday so i am clearer on this

is there something wrong with the 17 i ve been waiting at broadway and oak southbound for almost 30 mins
i just got on one thank you for the reply
5 days are you serious how will that help me when im standing in the rain waiting for another bus that isn t full tomorrow
no problem it happens i just wondered what was going on
was wondering the same thing woot thanks
how do i load my card is this not enough to do
i love you people who manage the twitter but come on what use is a couple of tickets to someone who already has a monthly pass
i requested it a week ago when i tapped it on the bus red light was appeared
until the hursonaitor jumps on
the driver said traffic would be nice if you had a policy to maybe radio other drivers on similar routes so you could ask
the 2 other buses that went by that stop didn t know what happened either
i will try that when i go home today
a bunch of people waiting for the c71 bay 6 55714 at surrey central
hop to it last i checked i pay your salaries
furthermore is it still a 3 zone pass like how the original student u pass was thanks for your help
fantastic i was worried that that was why i was having problems lol great to know
just learned from a bus driver that i m not supposed to tap when i leave a bus or translink facility as a u pass holder oops
oh correction he said i do have to tap in and out but maybe i tapped the wrong place when i got on the first train
sorry he changed his statement ud83d ude0a it was odd because it was only making funny noises on trains and not busses
who names two metro stops u00abpatterson u00bb and u00absapperton u00bb that u2019s not dyslexic friendly

we were waiting for the 110 bus at the metrotown bus loop bus came but the other bus was at the bay so he drove away
where is the driver of 12006 should have left 61323 on the 480 10 mins ago
do may upass count as reinbursements
check out the translink connection to surreymuseum lego exhibit
sooo i see the 2 26 601 but it s not moving bridgeport
your idea of compensation to passholders is giving us something we can give away but is useless to us you already did that for us
you have a seriously bad pr department if you think monthly passholders will be happy with this inane compensation
does the 99 ubc stop at fraser street
has the 410 bus route disappeared from existence been waiting at stop 56897 for 20 min next bus said many should have passed
this am 8 05 it came a bit late so the 8 07 430 was at the stopthere was no room and we thought he will loop around but it didn t
what time does the 50909 bus comes
thanks so much i m on it already
no hide nor hair of the 410 to new west for 15 minutes sposed to be every 7 crowded incompetence
i m walking back then if one does not appear i m going to be very angry
now or in an hour will 6 of them all appear at once
jesus fucking christ three 410 buses all in a pretty line incompetence
hi j ive all ready talked too someone from translink via phone and the issue has been sorted thanks for getting back to me
hopefully he s on break lol
i m at 60856 is the 410 coming to this stop
and now sitting across from guy with open sores on his face sure love the face to face seating arrangements on
there are two street signs with the correct spelling of carnarvon within about 50 feet smh
oh god now he s picking at them
145 bus drivers telling students to stop tapping in and out on buses and skytrain as it slows things down
did you pay for transit on may 22 wants to give you your money back
will do would also be good if drivers remind students not tap their phones and wallets to ensure a successful tap
i mean it s connected to my ubc id and it s totes a matter of not being used to it so im quite scared for penalties or whatnot
im taking the 410 to the skytrain at jaccombs and cambie is it affected by the detour not clear
where is the 438 go and the 442
literally having the exact same problem as yesterday i really hope i am not here for another half an hour ruining my day
gotcha it ll probs just take some getting used to thanks ud83d udc4d
i literally texted it 5 mins ago and it said 431 438 442 and now i wait another half an hour i called yesterday
and no one has any explanation where is the 410 now
i wish he was on break but he wasn t
is the 410 still coming to the st edwards stop

the 212 and 211 drivers are awful
can i use the faresaver tickets towards the purchase of a new monthly pass
i ve decided to give up on tapping out
no trains at 9 30pm fucking bravo dicks
keep waiting to see better signage for elevator after disembarking seabus from north vancouver so far nothing
folks are unaware if disembarking on the right side bay in vancouver off seabus bikes strollers going up escalators now bad
tiny signs on front top of escalator rails is not sufficient for folks to even realize no bikes strollers after seabus to van
over a month ago suggested also senior disabled seating area for benches in seabus waiting areas many older folks standing
these older folks will not even think to ask a younger person often not looking up due to mobile dev for a seat
already went to the trouble of writing a long comment to translink and even called the customer service about these issues
so given that was a few months ago nothing has been done yet there is special seating on buses and canada line skytrain well
please don t burn any birds nests this time
already did as stated in my last comment to your office maybe pass along my comments for me again don t know if you can or not
1 track service same amount of trains seems legit
poor method then to spend the time with suggestions that would make travellers safer and more considered when nothing changes
thanks for your time though maybe someone at the translink corporate offices should read twitter once in awhile
also have spent 2 years at least to get someone to communicate with granville global to get washrooms in vancouver waterfront
love seeing this giant relay add at waterfront station thanks whyirelay
washrooms not at a large busy transit hub is ludicrous have spoken to translink granville global bc tourism van city hall
response time to the silent alarm on board skytrain cars is impressive good job
every single place i ve contacted passes the buck and new visitors arriving or passengers do not have a washroom at waterfront
it s just plain ignorant that the folks spoken to do not use transit nor waterfront even escort folks to canada place wshrm
typical you suck
why not have more trains running on a concert night i get that evenings are 10 15 between but stadium is a mess right now

do we really need to turn on the heater on trains today it s summer train 231
your drivers should tell riders when there are re routes before they get off at stops had to backtrack and now i m late
thanks for the reply but not worth it this is not the first time however you need to teach your drivers traffic circle rules
rule is that those already in the circle have row over those wanting to get in we were circling he drove right in front of us
happens occasionally but normally not by professional drivers like buses and trucks normally those guys are trained
hopefully with onboard snacks and movies for iconvenienced commuters epicfail
edmonds none of them
attitude from the 212 driver 8 22am bus is real just what i wanted after a new 90 pass man i miss vanproblems
the sign at granville and dunsmuir wasn t visible no one knew

yup it is inaccurate the real website is wrong too it makes no sense
translink i m sure people would appreciate a voucher towards their next pass more than timely issuing of useless redundant faresavers
hey couldn t grab his name but the bus driver on the 112 leaving 22nd street at 5 41pm is a phenomenally friendly driver

do you provide weekly passes
got ta love how there are no alerts or notice so people can just wait endlessly for a bus that never shows up great job
if power rail runs left or right of skytrain what s that in the middle of the tracks
why does the 321 leave surrey central at 1132 i m always arrive a few minutes after
it would help too if after i transferred at columbia from millennium line that the next train is an expo and not another m line
no it didn t i just always arrive at 1135 just in time to miss it
thanks i just jump on a 96 and walk the rest it s just frustrating probably no way to push that departure time a few mins ud83d ude25
wow la is still awake lol thanks for the info i ll look it up i m a skytrain geek ud83d ude02 ud83d ude02
d so if power rail supplies trains with power the linear induction motor moves the trains omg i solved the puzzle lol
for which line the expo or mline
por fin casa ud83d ude00 bus stop 50465 9 in vancouver bc
i see so once it s completed expo trains will be more frequent i transfer from lougheed to columbia to get to surrey
as a tourist i rather be renting a car than taking transit in the future there should be weekly passes for tourists
yep translink s train monopoly really bothers me at times forced to keep handing them money
offers ahoy as launches summer offers with charity fundraiser
good morning would i be able to drop off the service disruption pass replacement form in person
king george station have same payments options for parking as scott road or only change how much is day parking there
is there a problem with the 152 it s 10 minutes late
train stopped at king george after track intruder alert went off platform packing up
zone pass 2 and scratched 2
personal pet peeve when someone cuts the line at a bus stop
sorry to bother u again what if i have zone pass 2 and scratched 2 amp how about going to downtown from lougheed stn pay extra
because it seems like from zone 2 gt 3 no charge 2 gt 1 also no charge
there were like 7 ppl standing and this guy just straight up walks in and cuts the line and stood behind i was in the front
there were like 7ppl standing and this guy just walks in and cuts the line and stood behind me i was in the front annoying
so i can no longer just buy a 28 day pass
a train just very quickly passed the braid station without stopping any idea why that was just curious is all
to clarify the train was headed towards sapperton so it was the wb train
i don t know i saw it coming as i arrived off the bus and ran up the stairs to meet it only to find it didn t even stop
as i ran up i remember thinking it was awfully loud up there because it passed through without even slowing down
i am too i couldn t hear the entire exchange but am sure the driver will report it
very interesting never seen that before ok thanks for letting me know
how many weeks have you been announcing that the city hall elevator is busted fixthatshiz
hey awkward but i just left a bottle of pills on the skytrain it s a vitamin bottle but over the counter ibuprofen inside help
on a train wb left new west station about 3mins ago i was seated in a single seat wondering if someone could have a look
why do you have the heat up or don t put on air conditioning on transit now that it s spring the seabus is like a human stew
is the 28 joyce still running down smith ave there is construction
the ticket puncher at metrotown has low ink on both of them please fix this
hey does this look okay to you
well two just went past and didn t wait ud83d udc4d great service for locals
so frustrating waiting for a 20 bus that doesn t show only to have 2 buses show up in tandem for the next scheduled arrival
hey i have a question can a senior use an adult fare saver 1 zone for a two zone concession travel
not impressed once again knowing how the c73 runs i arrive early to stop 55143 to catch my bus driver must be a nascar racer
that sounds kinda silly since a 1 zone adult is 2 75 same as the concession 2 zones i want a solution that does not need coins
i mean the previous bus departed at 9 28 am i was at stop at 9 33am
all good now on the bus just had to wait once again for the next bus this happens more than one knows
i see there s been a change in the time table then i must review the schedule excuse my blast ty for the update
if i couldn t tap out at a specific station and i leave and board a bus can i still tap in successfully
c3 is unpredictable with their changed times ive been waiting since 10 03 at busstop 61489
hi what time exactly is the next 17 downtown coming at stop 50742
when does the 502 surrey central come at stop 58946 i ve check translink and texted it but it s giving me 2 different times
im trying to catch either the 10 48 or 11 02 but when i texted both of those times have a beside it
from the bus to the boat northvan to yvr multimodal travel via fcm2015ac
oh okay thank you i thought the meant that it would be late or something
hey great service and a super helpful pleasant driver driving the 135 sfu bus b8146 right now
just wondering i have the upass but several times i haven t tapped out is there some way i can fix that without being charged
was the 11 35 braid station cancelled
ooh sorry 159 braid
that s what i thought how come it never showed up in my next bus text alerts
i havent bought it yet 2 zone pass 124 scratched 2zone q1 pay extra to dt from lougheed stn q2 pay extra to coq centre
thanks since i had to catch another bus could you give me the times for the 169 braid leaving coquitlam around 12 20
so thats up to me to pay extra if i want to because the zone rules arent very clear when i live in lougheed stn area
can more than one person still travel with a monthly pass holder on sundays thanks
a week later elevator at busy city centre station still out of order yes thefactsmatter i guess the disabled are sol
seems like the 145 has gone missing

hey you suck translink skytrain

the calm reassuring voice over the pa is not helping keep anyone in this overpacked hot tuna can
the prob is on expo line why you holding up millenium line from broadway commercial
brutal shanegibson damn skytrain slammed to a stop outside commercial station no warning fail did i mention no aircon
more people cramming onto platform middle of rush hour can t imagine the more dense stations
system service probs b w royal oak amp waterfront trains halted on expo line tells passengers to stay on trains vancouver
getting reports of skytrain problems on the expo m line any details sounds like trains down between royal oak amp waterfront
stuck on a skytrain smh
how long will the hold up be skytrain expoline stuck
when is it expected to be running again
hey look a problem with wow a first such horrible service
so hot might die
every day i have been on transit this week there have been delays i dislike paying for this service
perhaps there should be someone at burrard station telling people that you can t do your job and make trains move
trains on millennium line stopped at stations or just outside station working to fix situation vancouver
no skytrain out of downtown for at least 30 mins according to staff at burrard
fuck translink now how do i get home to delta ass holes you suck
just outside patterson must be boiling in those boxes
when does not have problems
fantastic job once again skytrain down once again wonder will they offer more useless fare savers for monthly pass holders fail
no need to thank me for my patience i don t have any looking forward to a packed un air conditioned train when one arrives
i d almost wonder if it s a safety concern considering these old trains have no air conditioning
what s up at the royal oak to waterfront sky train delays
translink skytrain amp expo amp m line delays on both lines r temporarily impacting service more updates 2 follow thank u 4 ur patience
when is skytrain gon na be up and running
there s a well deserved social media shit storm headed ur way lol system wide delays again bird s nest catch fire
translink reporting delays on expo and millennium skytrain services no details available on how long these delays will remain
cknw female overhead voice is not giving a time for a fix informing people not to leave their train
to passengers forcing doors open will only compound delays staff en route to drive trains manually did i hear that right
and you guys want more money uselesswankers
could we get more 19 buses to help with the delay of the skytrain
very vague announcements so no idea how long this delay is
how long apprx should we make arrangements for daycare pickup
does this mean that we who don t take the skytrain will get free passes again
is millenia line trains to vcc thru burnaby running
what a joke another reimbursement lol
phew i just got home from w front to patterson missed it by minutes i guess wait did i do something bad
some problems for riders on skytrain trains stopped across the system news1130 has calls in to as we wait to hear details
in surrey train on hold in surrey central station nice doors are open
the 116 from edmonds just left with half a bus full and stranded the rest of us was there an issue with that bus
i think this may be why they need more money
are both the sky train and canada line on hold
dude we can t hear anything you re announcing on the platform we re still clueless translinkfail
what a joke the amount of money we pay to support this system and every other day there s a problem
this failure brings out the good in some people a couple of people offered seats to others who were suffering from the heat
wtf why will it not go to braid
gon na be late for work cus is super unreliable what else is new
mt skytrain amp expo amp m line delays on both lines temporarily impacting service updates to follow bk
breaking system wide hold on skytrain at the moment no further details avail noh lordy sorry for commuters bcpoli cdnpoli
will monthly bus pass holders be compensated for delays n skytrain transit vancouver
your mobile app doesn t give me any other options to get to guildford from waterfront besides using skytrain option
this is unacceptable no eta for the delay there will be no compensation just have to suck it up like always fucking joke
millennium line now moving just left brentwood town centre still dealing with situation on expo line judging by announcement
to hell with them i d get off
so the 555 is changing so it goes to braid now adding alot of time to trips
translink telling passengers is that staff are being directed to manually drive some trains electronics problem at track level
you forgot the word again
pretty sure stanley park is smoke free why are your bus drivers smoking by the buses
nice job getting back on track communication is key fabulous
when the train stops amp then starts to go backwards twice
let me out of your train quit telling us not to open the doors i feel like a hostage
here we go again with delays delays and more delays doesn t fail always something going wrong with this system
you announce this now during a major skytrain delay
thank god i just got off it hate to be stuck on it in rush hour during this heat not a good combo
that s what riders stuck on the trains in this heat are going to be
how long will the skytrain be down for
how come the lines break down every day missing another appointment
how long minutes hours
not the best day to be taking the skytrain but overhead messages to passengers are frequent
there s better communication from today than when skytrain went down last summer
i take it that the trains are still down do you know how long any word n n translinkfail
translink amp skytrain go home ur drunk again
look at what s not a surprise the skytrain broken again
the meterotown skytrain platform is full can t find an attendant too many ppl
omg is this train moving it is
what is it this time a hungry pack of hummingbirds kept suckin on the orange cord till it broke
when the people come to drive the train i m stuck on just before a royal oak will the train go all the way to king george or
are you guys competing with toronto for most incompetent transit company let me guess free tickets for passholders again
will i have to try and figure out how to bus home from royal oak
this
of course right at rush hour again is translink attempting to make a point with all these rush hour problems
dear all expo line is broken again we have been advised to take a bus
the original plan finally begins
breaking a technical issue is causing a delay to skytrain service between royal oak and waterfront stations
how long and when are these issues are going to be resolved it seems every few weeks we have another issue
i just got home from petterson minutes ago i mean i tooted on the way out but that can t really stop a train can it
technical issue causing delay to skytrain and there are people stuck on trains told to stay put translink
opening the door real soon if you don t let me out consequences be damned
is millennium running from vcc
and the millennium line is stopped again at least the doors amp windows are open sorry expo line commuters skytrain vancouver
is so unreliable i think it s time to buy a car
30 mins delays shouldn t be called temporary delay
probably another birds nest or something how long ago was the last break only a few weeks
stuck in train how long does it take to drive us to station
might wan na hurry up and fix that before a large amount of people try to head downtown for
we ve got a lotta fans worried about getting to the show praying things get going
can not imagine being stranded on the train with kids in this heat translink why can t this service ever work efficiently
frequent sure but minimal information
more worried about people overheating in those old trains directly in the sun
how hard is it to keep one train line running apparently too hard for ncc
or was it another one of those nasty bird nest fires damnbirds
any idea if this is like a fix in fifteen fix in an hour or fix in a day situation useful to know before i start my commute
please get an attendant tthe escalator is backing up someone is going 2 get hurt no more people on the platform
thanks alot i guess i won t be having a few with friends since i have to drive with skytrain down again
u201c translink skytrain expo line trains still running between edmonds amp king george crews working to restore service bk u201d
skytrain proving everyweek the sky train is an unreliable form of transportation
yes delays suck but watching people yell at each other about windows open on an ac train is quite amusing entertainment
nope and it s crazy hot outside too people were already yelling and fighting on the platform
maybe it s about time you guys go for coffee and figure out plan how not to screw up all the time brutal free fares for month
well the 2 trains between metro and pattison sure aren t but the riders look ready to riot from where i m standing
how long minutes or hours can you please give us all some guidance

where can we board the bus bridge outside waterfront stn
davidhbrett train 022 has pregnant woman in urgent need of assistance
how do i get to edmonds from joyce collingwood with the skytain being shut down
does think that running a transit system for a small city is the same as 4 year olds playing with toy trains in their living room
seriously get your act together you know how much we vancouverites depend on you
employees are telling everyone major computer crash technical issues rather an understatement
key word here is again breakingnews skytrain breaks down again
seeing that skytrain is down sucks really hoping i can get from 22nd to edmonds
best way to get from metrotown to burrard station
whn the help will come so that atleast we can breathe in open air no signs of coming in the train from last one hour exhausted

the broken elevators announcements just put salt in the wound skytrain
lol how many service disruptions does it take to fix a poor system over 2 years of track maintenance on top of that pathetic
signs indicating delays would prevent ppl from validating fare only to find trains aren t moving would rather walk
you need to move this train by waterfront station to the platform people panicking and need to get off its the left train track

how about stop running buses that terminate downtown when people need to get eastbound

just tweeted out that they actually have no idea about an eta on restoring service
it s a stretch to assume we have patience it s only because venting or frustrations would be illegal
fyi translink spokesperson on tape with us said the hope is it will be fixed in 90 minutes
you should trademark thank you for your patience
tempers are running short here on an overcrowded 19 metrotown
translink making me want to pollute the earth by taking my car everywhere instead

translink it s a shame this isn t accessible for seabus passengers
019 at bus stop 58008 hasn t come for past few buses any idea when it will be here
kudos to anne drennan police spokesperson for once again stepping up in front of cameras but why her amp not comms shop
but is she working for the police or translink itself
good q she is billed as translink police spokesperson where it translink spokesperson
any explanation for the empty charter coaches looping through vancouver
this was not a policing issue it was operational issue requires comms shop to step up
num 9 bus driver at 530 today 2124 was simply amazing during such a stressful time made sure everyone got on it
is the millennium line working especially from production thanks
i m proposing handcars on the skytrain tracks and pay me millions of dollars
why do trains time out in the middle of the day
the vancouver skytrain is a bad joke i wonder how manages to screw it up so often especially at rush hours
as usual has no idea what s happening oh i don t know where your bus is maybe he s taking a break useless cust service
i thought i saw an email recently with translink only might have faulty memory

skytrain shut down caused me to miss class attendance is mandatory better not fail my exam now getyourshittogether
after a 2 5 hour commute home with 2 young kids the only positive aspect was the awesome driver on 19 into downtown
instead of 50 minutes it took me over 2hours and 30 minutes to get home today you need to improve these skytrain tracks
i think bus drivers should be more forgiving with the delays that happened i understand c75 is only allowed 24 why not 25
stuck one in a half hours on the skytrain today and had to spend 4 hours on transportation to get home thanks you once again
tell that to their 20 year old software that runs the system
beer no 2 because it shouldn t take 4 hours to get home skytrainf cranberry sour
asleep at the switch
as would i the system is so old it doesn t get proper updates maintenance
or delays from mercury retrograde take things slowly shania and sing some songs twice
can i get a refund i ended up having to drive into vancouver and didn t use my passes due to the break down
is the millennium line still down
i think i m buzzed blame
smart business owners don t hire skytrain commuters time is money
passengers fault n nuh huh sure
doesnt seem to be doing a difference anyways
so 20 can sit and four can stand
so we put more into this broken system
honked at by one of your drivers in poco tonight while bicycling safely on the road sharetheroad
ya the passengers who were kept captive in hot weather are the ones to blame here skytrain excuses fail
i hope the passengers who caused the additional delay were either ticketed or charged
i hope the passengers who caused the additional delay by breaking out were either ticketed or charged not cool
posted before i read the latest updates
so why can the normal buses pack the aisles full of standing
indeed the entire line must be walked by staff the moment someone breaks out of a train assholes
stop blaming passengers and get your shit together i don t even use transit amp am sick of hearing poor ppl being trapped
they should also immediately manually return trains to station not 1 and a half hours later
lets keep the focus on where it belongs with translink
you wouldn t leave your dog on a train with no ac for 30 minutes why should your riders be any different skytrainfail
is the expo line fine to ride now
they can u2019t manually drive trains without power which can u2019t be turned on until the tracks are clear
the disruption is over after i walked for how long
thanks for getting the skytrain service running normally by the time i walked an hour from main to comm full buses passed otw
another stellar rush hour for finally home after 2 1 2 hours icing on the cake no bus either super areyoukiddingme
thanks for that tidbit so people jumped out right away
the main weak point is was the lack of backup power for the train intercom can t use pa when powers off
why is blame mutually exclusive passengers can be idiots but translink regularly puts customers in those situations
okay well that should be fixed with the 5
good to know my safety is less a concern on bigger buses then shuttle buses
that s why it s called the l r cruiser ud83d ude21
jaydajaysexshow thanks for following jayda ud83d ude0a ps i blame retrograde and equally for the skytrajn meltdown ud83d ude09

2 white mercedes you got ta sell a lot of to do that garbage
wow another outage maybe you should consider upgrading your software to windows me i m grateful i m carpooling these days
yup i ve read that s in the upgrade plans
i don t understand why transit isn t free tonight skytrains were down for a few hours or more and we get nothing from it
lost communication sounds like the same thing that happened to transit in toronto this morning
i m a commuter but can t do much about idiots forcing doors open and delaying system startup even more stayonthetrain fools

not one bus has passed on w georgia
operating is a bit of s stretch
seabus service cancelled until further notice due to suspicious package check for updates
oh man this was my plan b if w georgia hadn t reopened
alright your staff response on the ground has been quite good kudos
full marks to bus here and loading super got them to change route to go direct to quay which is where riders needs to go bonus
you should probably tell your employees not to laugh on the intercom when trying to apologize
lots of people lining up at the regular 210 211 bus stops downtown trying to get to north van maybe send more buses there
did the shutdown of the seabus keep you from shopping with us you can call 6042694300 for phone orders while you wait staysafe

i thought they were going to fix this it s 5 59
have to hand it to and their rapid response to the emergency especially during rush hour seabus
kudos to for getting me to the shore even with the seabus shut down quickly
i agree translink communicated very well
unlike that driver b8136 stopped despite a bus full sign and actually had room for all of us
i assume there s no estimated time for the seabus to be up and running again ps awesome job on twitter during this time
seabus not running but link has a shuttle departing across from waterfront great recovery thanks
so what happened to the 5 59 4 from ubc left nis without passengers would be nice if the driver said something longline

i think you mean cuz wouldn t do that sorta thing
will the seabus be back by tomorrow morning or will there be a shuttle available at waterfront to get to north van
are sky trains behind schedule due to seabed closure or is all running normally
you need to fix the escalator at the bridgeport skytrain it sounds like a small dog is trapped in there
and bus depot is moving from 3rd amp st davids to burnaby amp s w kent dumb
will u inform the public via twitter when its operational can u provide direct link as to where on the website we can find info
very friendly staff directing people to special buses after seabus incident hope to be home soon
erroneous article translink never owned the building check land titles badreporting lazyreporter
it was a suspicious package on seabus presumably bomb squad is on site
usual pick up drop off area at the quay is fenced off better to be picked up at chesterfield if you need to seabus
u0645 u0627 u0626 u0629 u0639 u0627 u0645 u0645 u0646 u0627 u0644 u0646 u0633 u0628 u064a u0629 n at u2014

u got to wonder how got internal oversight at all then end it bcpoli vanpoli
in northvancouver the police incident involving the seabus has been resolved all services back to usual routes km
soon and resuming are 2 very different things
let me guess lost backpack
indeed is the security theatre over for the night
i would pay a quarter extra to too if they could somehow install sneeze guards on the canada line vancouver transit worthit
or eggmcmuffin out of asshole s hands snatchers
you may appreciate my comments am westcoaster on this news of the seabus suspicious pkg n
does that yellow skytrain truck crane thing that i sometimes see does that have a name
it is time to have more promotion about citizens being more alert about any unattended packages
better safe than sorry folks props to for keeping commuters safe

not surprised nobody in this day and age knows what a walkman looks like lol
hi where was the bus 129 at 8 36pm on gilmore henning thks he didn t come
surrey needs skytrain expansion not a light rail transit surrey 4 stops 1 zone roads were just fixed thissucksyvr
direction metrotown but i don t now the id
whats happening with your westbound trains been waiting for so long and no communication from skytrain staff
it might be a good idea to reevaluate how many eastbound trains there are at this time of day
least you can do is tell customers whats happening poor service its really disappointing
heard it was a walkman
girl they are busy saving the seabus from 80s era personal music listening devices
yes or an extra quarter for air diffusers with nice natural essential oils that would make me so happy
whelp didnt know i had to send carrier pigeons to get in touch with translink ud83d ude29
thank you your power rail replacement caused me to miss a bus i had 25 minutes and 3 stops to make it s 30 minutes the next
s o to for having a packed skytrain come to the completely full platform at metrotown station 15 minutes late
translink where can we find information on the cause and resolution of the suspicious package call
its ok but your staff is slackin no one at commercial to answer questions or let riders know whats happening ud83d ude15
no bus at nanaimo and 1st ave finally a not in service bus at 3 43 driver let a number of ppl off didn t communicate and left
bobmackin why the hell is it ok to shut down a transit route for 3 hours for a walkman
i don t understand how you don t alter your bus schedule for station connections when you know this work is happening
it s more than we have here
shutting down for the night does translink need reform probably to some extent some major foul ups but do we need more 1
hey get the province to fire the board as step one elect members to 4 year terms instant accountability
translink any estimate of the dollar amount wasted over the banal walkman
got ta be honest if true this is unacceptable as a reason to disrupt so many ppl s commutes
i can t possibly imagine what would ve happened if they found a record player on that seabus vancouver
like you shelby i completely agree lots of folks just don t get it besafe
having lived in london england i remember the unforgettable bombings in the tube
german tourist arrested for sexual assault aboard skytrain yell amp bring attention to yourself awesome work for catching him
nope it was bc transit
so those of that count on a specific bus to get home at a reasonable time are just out of luck
four hours for a walkman
most people are great but i experience one or two awful people per week
a walkman seriously
where s the 61100 bus it skipped time
i m sure you re really sorry though i don t suppose you d have the link where i could a file a complaint
agreed i heart 98 of the time transit vancouver i do wish there was a better connection with cda line amp skytrain s
the walkman has been secured repeat the walkman is secure
where the fuck is the 61100 bus i ve been waiting for 35 fucking minutes in the cold
is the seabus already working
you guys need to put ads up asking people to use their fucking brains before being paranoid over things like goddamn walkmans
ngos contend w unrelenting cuts amp must account for every red cent if only translink s greed was redistributed
thanks the 240 did come and we had just enough room to get on
you mean better safe than sony
the suspicious package on the seabus was an old style walkman is no one from born before 1980
would u rather no work and have breakdowns every week service is every 15 minutes through work area it s said everywhere
they had nearly 4 hours to figure it out someone had to have looked at it
you mean fare gates forced on by bcgov costing 9m yr to maintain to solve 3m 7m yr fare evasion problem
great work today but please stop focusing message on women speaking up amp focus on telling men to stop harrassing women vaw
i work as a cook on the ns if i miss the last 232 it takes me 45 minutes to get home why not extend 232 hours
go fuck your selves
out of curiousity do you guys auction off your retired buses or scrap them
translink_ni ciaran rogan talks to about strike disruption via translink
to europa buscentre where run buses to dublin every hour almost hope that s helpful
real question is who ordered them to sell it in the first place and why context is important

you could help us all by not striking on friday translink
irrational fear paranoia
joyce stn is full of all the people and none of the trains are there delays this morning
sorry for all the questions but does that mean the 829 one isn t coming now either
three trains in quick succession now
thx to the irrational promotion of fear
what s with the skytrain westbound hold ups nanaimo station is packed and no trains
bus driver yelling out the window while bus is moving then complaining about all the homeless drug adicts who want to get hit
broadway skytrain riders waiting and packed to other platform what s up
so we should delay everything amp suffer until the changes the rules they obviously don t think are broken
or wait until another election amp hope the make a bigger deal of it than they ever have in the past
guys been waiting at commercial for 10 mins along with 5000 other people more trains please
appreciate the quick reply
translink 15 minutes now to get on at main st thissucksyvr
nope but i appreciate how many you re sending nobody can get on as every train is full
skytrain car mark i 099 at back doors not working properly not opening then closing
just heard that yesterday s shut down of the seabus was caused by an old walkman how paranoid have we become
5 99s passed at fraser amp broadway w o stopping we pay for this
how about the building they bought yesterday bought and sold and lost millions then re buy good job
they didn t win teddy lifetime award for great decisions fare gates should be everywhere and people pay
you guys are the definition of a joke
it takes two to tango translink and cubic are hiding the truth from the public about costs and glitches
is the 4 on its way to stop 50445
the hippo represents and the runner is our wallet i certainly hope he gets away
not full just let out 3 passengers i stood out of their way my turn bus door closed amp zoomed by i was standing in front of bus
the driver could see me clearly hell the passengers were shaking their head in disbelief
at terminal now lady driver inside parked bus on bus phone door closed with a few passengers outside in the pour waiting
handy dart service is bad
why do have to be striking the day i have an exam in belfast and no other way to get there
it s anonymous right i know her i m a regular not the nicest of among the other c23 drivers
i notice you re in ireland is actually for transit in vancouver bc canada the one you need is ck
what would you suggest to improve on this battered bus drivers do you actually have an idea sensationalism
thanks hi is there something i can help you with
the public should just boycott translink for their shit service
temps are mild today you can turn down the heat on skytrain 048
check out publicservice canada
so do you have concrete tangible evidence to support your statement or media sensationalism
n nthere s talk of a terrorist merger between suspicious walkman and suspicious flashlight
what does ac mean at the end of a schedule from the text
the 43 that was scheduled for 10am departure at joyce station broke down any chance a replacement bus is coming
from the 43 bus
shout out to the 84 bus driver who gives us weather updates once we reach ubc he always makes my morning commute great cc
no sign of the c88 ladner exch heading south near cove link rd this morn 10 09 any idea if the bus was running early or late
just like an airplane pilot
is it legal ethical for a corner store to sell individual bus tickets ie not a whole book but singles from the book
yes sends the message that they should carry on as before fix translink first and if they still need then fine
and yes the build in ownership was bc transit but is ex of publicly managed money for transit mismanaged patterns
exactly he s made it a negative campaign about the character of good to know who he is too
any suggestions to help remedy or just complaining for the sake if complaining btw don t believe what the media
i u2019m ok i do this every few weeks when i forget to duck the doors on the old trains are about 2cm shorter than i am
again get your facts straight before believing the media province and translink 2 separate things
no sends message that people don t care about public transit lets translink and christy off the hook
lets not send the message that s it s ok to be wasteful and that you ll be praised for making poor decisions
where is 11 02 340 at 56023
the 28 bus hasn t come yet and it was scheduled to be here 7 minutes ago any delays
yep i u2019m an idiot it generally happens when i u2019m still half asleep so forget that wakes me up though
will it be leaving soon
translink can i have my walkman back this chumbawamba tape won t play itself
what s up with the 97
it came but next bus said it wasn t coming for 15 minutes
changing to stadium chinatown amp joyce collingwood was not a problem why should this be such an issue
351 just ignored 30 people waiting at south surrey park and ride didn t even come in any reason
your tv is broken
if i ran my group homes like has managed the funds we have paid i would be in jail its a broken trust
well the second bus just passed but this time it had the bus full message i guess we know why
jack froese now denying he ever said that but yes side do have access to up to 6m from
i wished i had recorded the call someone has a copy of the recording get it then check out about the 7 47pm mark
hey i know how much sucks i ride it every day but i can not abide the status quo
if no side wins it s not like they re gon na get together amp demand changes to nothing will happen
tell you idiot busdrivers to actually stop bus v9569 on route 41 just blew past and it was not full
but i can still use the card itself normally
scents permeating from passengers onboard your vehicles is a real problem please inform riders of appropriate aroma etiquette
it is all about perception is one of the best agencies in north america full stop

that was at commercial on the millennium expo line
does this have anything to do with translink or are the bnc liberals hiding from that one too
does this have anything to do with translink or are bc liberals hiding from that one too
no idea don t know even who the property authorities are to be honest
eb car 002 door closing chimes not working catching people unaware of impending door closure
who manages the expansion projects you guys the or the province this is what it hinges on for most
my issue was the fact they were told not to use that system and went ahead la has a great one same idea but it works
oh dear a distraction that was created by provincial legislation 2 avoid transit decision making
djtripd govt covers the shortfall
two omissions from the 10yr transportation plan no shuttle 4 hwy 16 amp no changes 2 bcpoli
that would be stealing his boss christy clark s favourite line
no changes anytime soon a distraction no its part of the problem
translink is the problem they are responsible for the transit system we currently have
so he doesn t close the door on changes at some point in time but certainly not anytime soon bcpoli
facepalm mt u201c woodfordcknw980 he doesn t close the door on changes at some point in time but certainly not anytime soon bcpoli u201d
woodfordcknw980 so is not apparently as dumb as his boss christy clark then translink bcpoli
needs to sack their current social networking person he doesn t let translink take responsibility for mistakes
can you get the guy and his dog off of the train pulling into renfrew station
well you already have the run poorly part working great
they got off at rupert station no the dog wasn t in a kennel it was sitting in a seat
nothing like having an emotionally mental exhausting day to than be in an accident via can this day be over now
is there a way to tell the 3 digit number from inside the train
this is an article i can agree w bcpoli vanpoli u201c cbcstephenquinn still depressed over here
yo why the buses so late tho

new type of commuter the loud listener who has music blasting from their earphones
lol there must have been a sale
on the 169 coming into coq there is a loud strumming noise from the back is this normal i smelled burning rubber for a moment
106 just left metro didn t ask if breaks were on stroller hadn t even settled myself in let alone get my little one settled
no i just left the bus i heard the sound before on other new busses too but never smelled burning rubber except this time
you bet i will usually they are so good about asking if brakes are on not this time
22nd st is clearly in the 9 gmt time zone
5 18 bus at stop 61936 let ppl on near the end of the lineup amp now it s packed those at front have to wait longer for next bus
doesn t seem fair to those who are forced to wait longer due to this kind of defeats the point of a lineup
geez king george skytrain station smell like pot surrey
thanks for putting a bus stop out the front of a ferrari dealership sensitive
yes that was taken this afternoon perhaps have someone look at it it was the validator on the left as you enter the stn
would have been quite challenging to explain if you were checked for your ticket
a bike sitting stripped of its parts at lake city skytrain station ghetto af
yeah no doubt that could have landed me a nice fine officer i swear i just validated it
i validated my ticket at burrard station at 5 06 and it gave me an expiration time at 5 36
no i left actually the bus driver at 22nd station caught it to my attention it was the machine close to royal center at burrard
is there a worse night to be on the bus than st patricks at least halloween drunks wear costumes also 6pm night apparently
understandable but now doubly frustrating to have seen the earlier 7 leave as the 25 to ubc pulled in always bad timing there
twitter sure makes the busride go fast and there goes my stop
there you go twitter is responsible for you seeing more of your great city amp giving those climbing legs more exercise
better transit means an overhaul of not giving them a
it should stop your scare mongering
better transit means an overhaul of not giving them a blank cheque are you blind to their incompetence

is the26 bus leaving 29th station at 8 48 cancelled or just running late

is the evergreen line going to replace the 97 b line what happens to that bus when the trains start running
dear am i going to be able to actually get on a train at edmonds tonight
apparently there are only 3 things that brings out the worst in vancouverites hockey beer shortage amp plebiscite fb
people just don t like trust the company translink which is why a no is likely

totes magoats send me a train set course coquitlam
do you know the eta for the 159 at braid
i don t know what you did but it eventually totally came
that is exactly what a lot of women utter
the detailed info doesn t seem to be there
too subtle for the average canuck eh
thanks since many residents can take 97 along guildford way easily and skytrain will run along barnet hwy
it s like name calling is a legitimate replacement for facts transit
probably a wise move given history amp record of poor fiscal responsibility to bc ers
i notice is trending in vancouver but we are being told the plebescite is not about the governance perhaps we disagree
news1130radio but it won t stop their projects either
humungous guy ducking on skytrain to fit in these trains are not very goliath friendly get your sh t together transittales
hi just missed connection to gc train st central because train late from petrie thank you qr and translink compo available
when is translink and the depot gon na sort it out or will i continue to miss two or three connections in a row every evening
i am a colleague of and we often take the same bus that being the 49 metrotown three door boarding would be great
why is there no quality control in the answers provided on twitter because qr and translink honestly do no care about us
i never wrote this comment
i never wrote this comment someone has hacked my account to write this translink
someone hit the intruder strip train stopped suddenly and my daughter hit her head not good
too late it was hours ago it enhanced her concussion
sadly no just sunburns but i did develop a great deal of appreciation of the punctuality of our transit system
at stop 28 on junction road at 4 42 for the 4 44 chermside bus still waiting translink fails me again
i will never understand why the city and translink do not take more initiative to set dedicated bus only lanes
thanks for reply da it s rather frustrating to live in the downtown core and feel like i live in a transit desert
okay thank you u263a ufe0f on it now this twitter account for translink is brill ud83d ude88
no problems reported at this time butthedayhasjuststarted
here at braid st 169 bus to coquitlam 6 51 didn t show now i m late for work explanation please

delays on the wce this morning notsurprised
and train 3 of wce has engine problems limping out of port moody station
from wce conductor we are experiencing engine problems moving ahead at a reduced speed hopefully we keep going mayneedapush
westcoastexpress train 3 conductor announced we are having engine problems running at slow speed hopefully we keep going
the wce train is having engine problems our conductor is hoping we can carry on at a reduced speed to vancouver
do they ever run on time
we are stopped the tracks not looking good
wce train 3 is currently stopped on tracks may impact train got ta love sugarcoating
wce train 3 is stopped now
translink no we didn t keep going stopped by barnet marine park westcoastexpress
wce train 3 is currently stopped on tracks may impact train got ta love sugarcoating
we are to get a push from train 4
stuck on the west coast express train 3 until the next train 4 comes up behind us and gives ours a shove into downtown
wce train 3 is now waiting for train 4 to push us in to waterfront
per more wce problems train 3 stopped west of barnet 21 min late amp counting may have to pushed in by train 4
if train 4 does have to push in train 3 what s the estimated delay on train 4
traveling from production station to sapperton station do i need to purchase a 1 zone or 2 zone transfer
hey wce i don t pay 250 a month to sit on the tracks figure it out
what s with all the lurching stops on the train this morning
will this locomotive breakdown affect afternoon trains on wce lateforschool
my son does that all the time with his thomas trains
this is what a harasser looks like for no reason this guy harassed me when i sat down in front of him
westcoastexpress moving again being pushed by train 4
there s a huge lineup for the 239 capilano bus at phibbs how much longer do we need to wait for a bus
that wouldn t even build a 4 lane road beyond 2 miles big deal
are bus drivers allowed to be listening to ipods while driving
hey my kid is sending over thomasthetankengine to help wce 3
you really ought to step up on 15m unpaid transit tickets the additional funding should come from here not charge us more
when is the next 239 to cap coming to phibbs i missed it due to a massive line increasetheservice
we re good now safety wasn t an issue just a jerk left shortly after btw driver said he never paid watch for him
it would be nice if the 130 28 ran all the way to cap all year so i wouldn t be forced to take this bus
way to go guys bunch of clowns
yippe now lets try this again good morning customer information is now open no problems reported at this time
haha still premature sitting at station while train 4 is unloading what job what boss what s a start time
typical our train an hour late so push us underground without an update and let the later train disembark first
when is the escalator to street level in granville station going to be fixed it s been a week or more
why does wce4 get to unload 1st when wce train 3 is hour late is tranlink going to pay for being late to work amp should refund us
will any refunds be issued for the 1 hour delay this morning wce
there seems to be a lot of traffic along e 22nd ave where is the 25 to ubc at 51555
wait doesn t 3 come before 4
so when can i expect the next bus at this rate i m going to be late for work
whoever is driving 10 2195 this morning is awesome
translink time to get your act in order 14 a day for wce and delays like these is too much backtocar wcefail
wce train 5 stopped on tracks no announcement from staff n nany eta
yeah it did i guess the 8 33 just came super early then ahaha thank you
train 5 now stuck waiting why were we not warned how much longer
train 3 is already 50 minutes late let s drop off train 4 first thanks guys wce
this may explain issues commonsenseaintsocommon
thanks for the update communication from wce sadly lacking
so because of this issue this means no lunch for you and a later train home
it was late more than 1 hour we were out at 8 48 am please update it properly
taking the express out of westcoastexpress today eh joke figureitout morningsauna
how could that not have been anticipated why not tell people before we re stuck
being a daily commuter means you don t take the wce just for fun
wow terrible service re wce 3 this morning 1 hr stuck speakers weren t working no staff anywhere brutal
late again train still not moving n nthis is not good enough n n wce
i m at vancouver city centre skytrain station in vancouver british columbia
apparently 200 month isn t enough to get us to work on time
somebody at wce must have known the delay was pending incompetence again
stuck on the wce for 30 min just outside waterfront station
translink i wonder if wce should stand for we come eventually vs west coast express
over an hour late for work thanks to faulty engine in train 3 ugh

hey usually we re friends but not when i go to pay a fine amp the office listed on the ticket is not the place to pay it ud83d ude1f
translink already questionable that the wouldn t tell my wife to go validate her faresaver instead of ticketing
translink especially when main street station is confusing as its under construction
translink this office move is insult to injury ud83d ude1f
so today we re not friends we ll see about tomorrow
a bit fickle no
i m referring to the blur validator boxes not being very clearly marked during construction
we found the office but had to pay an extra zone to get there that s disappointing
regardless fine has been paid just frustrated by the whole experience
hi la my favorite translink person ud83d ude02 ud83d ude00

the driver of bus 2135 gets off on lecturing elderly disabled people

it is odd it s been like this all week uslly 2 kg trains 4 evry vcc but now it s 3 or 4 kg for evry vcc
not to mention volume sending 3 car trains to vcc that are packed when 4 car kg empty
then why did you tweet them

wce the conductor on train 1 just announced that we are stopped to let a freight train go by and follow behind it
your welcome but the next time you talk to the cpr you may want to ask them why we didn t go first we re delayed now
has wce just given up on customer satisfaction and efficiency nanother day another delay
did you cancel the 3 58 stop of the 395 at king george station it no showed again
between signals amp freight trains it s a miracle that wce gets anywhere these days would love to see the on time stats from
wce 1 running 15 mins behind
thanks and i m pretty sure train 2 is going to be impacted we haven t even made it to second narrows and barely moving
all trains too full for any passengers by the time they get to stadium station god i love transit
you know something has to be done about this nonsense to be made late on purpose is not acceptable
new update stopped just past second narrows trying to be patient and polite but this is ridiculous
this is ridiculous i stopped taking the train because of this and every time i try again i get stuck no faith in transit
wce guess what the conductor now said we re now waiting for a train to cross in front of the train that is delaying us
curious how more money for will improve wce are we going to pay cp off so they let us be on time anyone
train 2 stopped no transit alerts train 1 delayed too come guys this is getting tiresome for being most expensive pass
we need info on wce people have childcare arrangements to make and rely on
i d have to go with lack of something better
caught them by surprise again its not like we take this route every day
tl is currently renegotiating contract with cp further the plan calls for 10 new carriages and one new train
don t bus drivers have to prove they can drive before getting behind the wheel stop pumping the breaks everyones gon na get hurt
why it take 40 minutes to tell us
stuck on the wce again delays seem to be the normal now horrible service
please explain track priority to customers we thought wce had priority during train times stopping again
7 weeks into this commuting thing w amp the last 2 weeks haven t been so great somethingsgottagive wce vancouver latetrains
left waterfront on wce1 at 3 50 4 40 haven t even made it to port moody some express commuter train
wce 1 over 30 mins late not 10 waiting for a freight which is waiting for another freight cpbullied

translink y day the train broke down today signal issues tomorrow thetranslinkthatcouldn t
what s going on the the 16 45 ish 228 from lonsdale quay no bus huge lineup
the real question is why does this keep happening the wce runs the same schedule everyday 2trains1track
it was late more than 1 hour we were out at 8 48 am please update it properly
wce it was late more than 1 hour we were out at 8 48 am please update it properly
train 1 has arrived at port moody 35 minutes late
what s been going on with wce over the last few months seems like is not playing nice
we pay for this time on the tracks do we not how is it that we are delayed and why aren t they fined every time
just rode bus 8091 from ubc to downtown every so often the back smells like diesel fumes mostly when bus accelerates
no reason for the lack of communication though that is the easiest and cheapest thing to get right
so much for busses every 8 minutes 2 pass ups and counting 410 eastbound
highway 1 eb backed up to 160th glad i m on the bus but hov is sluggish 555
wow this is like an easy cut and paste daily tweet does translink have any recourse when this happens
when s the next 28 due to pass stop 51765 still waiting
thanks know it s not your fault you are just the front line
can you get them to turn the air on car 109 it s pretty stuffy in here
its west coast express
perhaps should fine people who hold the train doors open and delay service for everyone else someone u2019s going to lose a limb
you could get official app won u2019t be nearly as fun tho
wat is w ur buses that r on tram lines shut off in the middle of an intersection amp the drivr has 2 get out 2 restart unsafe
this happens a lot also they stop abruptly and people on the bus go flying not sure if it s the operator or the vehicle
how about train 4 and 5 any delays
drinking an irish style lager by at u2014
someone needs to do something about the flag gers on north road giving the bus driver grief for dropping riders off
worried about your safety on the skytrain or at skytrain stations don t worry won t do anything about it justcall911
another hour lost to westcoastexpress or cn pulling freight during peak on purpose time to investigate
do you expect people to take the bus if it doesn t even show up whereismybus
56689 suppose to be here 8min ago and this happens least once a week
new buses have air conditioning but people still open the windows hrm maybe because they never set it up properly
set ambient temp 2 or 3 degrees people wear jackets in vancouver jeeze
they understand it as only that specific vehicle and pursue a maintenance issues for that one vehicle it s a fleet issue
i m waiting for 407 for more than 25 minutes 630 just showed up but the last one did not
is anyone allowed to stand forward of the red line on a bus was told today uniformed transit can thought it blocked mirrors
okay but if that person is obstructing the mirrors as i was once told quite rudely by a driver then for casual conversation
even if in a uniform it s still obstructing the driver s view to be safe still could talk behind the red line easily yes
thank you for the replies will call
where you pay 120 a month to not be able to get on transit because it s so full made 4 transfers today via rts just to ride
it was on the trains from vancouver to richmond to vancouver to burnaby not uncommon for this to happen
suoer frustrating most who do that get on train and laugh too jerks
next train is in 4 minutes let it go it s not funny it s annoying
i don t want to hear ding ding ding 10 times at every stop
and then they hold it for the next clown
not much the attendants in green jackets can do either wave their fingers with disapproving frowns
people ignore them
not like they have authority to stop the train and drag the perps off although that u2019s what they should do
it s okay just had a chat with someone at the number you gave and they thought no one should stand in front of red line
we discussed the safety issue also obstructing folks getting on off the bus at the front so rules for some and not for others
so he is going to pass along my query and comments good as maybe there is a policy that has not been addressed about this
always know can rely on good service with translink on twitter amp on the phone gold stars to both of you
and yes its fully activated had it since the 28th of april
the 7 10 335 bus was full again a 30 minute wait is trash you need to reassess your schedules
get your free chance of burning excess fat uqrxk
amp in the mean time guess i ll bs every bus driver or officer i see usually wouldn t be so agressive but after this long omg

train is stuck at gilmore stn due to two jackasses who held open the doors while they were closing attendant on site
you must love traffic congestion
can t stand it but in my opinion translink has already proven they can t be trusted why give them more money
weird they are better than avg in cost efficiency and administration costs what do you want from them
you re my favourite translink person ciara u2764 u2764
i want them to find a way to get more money without taking it out of my pocket and more bike paths what a joke
you realize this will just end up costing you more in the long run these upgrades are very necessary
where do you think money comes from to pay for stuff

all you need to do is have 3 staff to assist w suitcases up all those stairs the older visitor should not have to attempt
you should do this for your customers too much friction
why did the train just stop right after leaving new west station
what about folks travelling the other way going to the airport and need to figure out what to do at van city centre w luggage

the leading cause of unemployment in bc is being late due to translink s inability to tell time

401 bus is terrible especially during salmon festival people live amp work on this route and we are sick amp tired of sorry bus full
how can you seriously delay the night train by so much and offer no extra time on our transfers
all your old trains need to be replaced noise pollution unbearable continuous use of your trains will lead to hearing loss
your old trains cause noise pollution daily use leads to hearing loss stress you are hurting your passengers
the only reason you continue to exist is because people are too lazy to do something about your greedy ways
how is giving a 173 fine to full time low income university student who commutes 3hrs a days to ubc studying science fair
your executives are all greedy pigs who do nothing for the people while guzzling their money to increase your own salaries shame
the projects for years and years and years so people get lazy and forget you took hard earned money and gave it to yourselves
do you have any idea how much 173 is to a low income full time university student studying science tuition over 7000 a year
your executives are criminals you should be finned 173 million for being greedy filthy pigs
well done great service 39mins in peak hour waiting for a bus boooooooo translink ud83d udc4e ud83c udffc
fix the fucking machine
my girlfriend told you about it 5 months ago but i guess we should give you more money that would fix it
maybe standing around waiting for an attendant is normal for your business but real world non monopoly
17 mile train ride 22 minutes and u00a36 on i wonder how that compares to rest of europe seems steep to me

the skytrain jolted to a halt at 22nd station we sat there for 10min and weren t allowed off we got sent through to edmonds

wonder how much they will lose on this project worldclassmismanagement
i waited a while and eventually got a purchase confirmation by email seem like it went through but it was a tad buggy
next bus also said there would be one at 11 39 but the bus is just getting here now
that doubles my commute hence why 7 of my neighbours drive to the downtown core every day in sovs
i m not promoting riding the skytrain simply state waste of money with the let s save 30m year
are you buying a ticket or the bus company n russellyuen
it is not obvious already what s the problem is a waste of money money that does not have

what is the actual difference between the prohibited soliciting and what they are doing
this does not describe a non commercial endeavour
i usually use one adult one zone month pass and concession faresavers for the kids have extra adult one zone faresavers too
join my club and bring your money would be prohibited but this is not it s exactly the same
and of course soliciting means to seek or request commercial or not
we definitely have that problem at all west coast express stations too line congestion means missed taps amp busses
this morning on 22nd station one of the machines didn t dispense the fare after putting in the money it read the amount put in
is over sufficient neither the machine gave me back my change nor the fare there was no sky train support staff there
the incident occurred between 9 20 9 30 this morning and it s the second time something like this had happened with me
this just happened again vcc clark sign and audio at waterfront train 342

it u2019s not the hardware it u2019s the passenger flow wce disgorges 100 people who all line up to use 1 of 2 tap out points bedlam

thanks for the clarification you guys are about answering
i was stunned to see my friend purchase a 7 worth of 1 zone fare from templeton station canada line
on a sunday ud83d ude31 ud83d ude32 ud83d ude27
7 worth of 1 zone fare from templeton station canada line that s absurd
what about us that work on sea island not fair we have to pay the extra 5 each way to get to work this needs 2 be fixed
so you will fix the issue before next month and save me a trip to stadium station
yes but why bother tapping in and out if a the gate is open and b i ve paid my fare via the monthly pass
thanks was a concern because w this extra cost on top of pass i may as well drive a car i have a great commute amp want 2 stay
we need 24 hour service 24hrs listentothepeople retweet telleveryone
on sunday my kids and i were charged from the stored value rather than the valid monthly pass i had to go stadium station office
i did tap out
and i m assuming the same answer applies to the canada line

this happens every single day fix it
good to see that still has some good drivers hats off to the driver of 410 r7229 for waiting for the lady running for the bus
the bus before went by 20 minutes before that on a route as busy as the 25 for this to consistently happen is unacceptable
is something up with bus 320 at surrey central and no driver for 25 min missed last one and running late for meeting
nothing like standing in front of an empty bus with no driver 5 min after it was supposed to leave i ve been here for 10 min
how my auntie get to easter seal house from

why is the 49 bus taking forever
if i tapped in and out at a train station then if i tap in again at a bus within 5 mins do i get charged 1 75 twice
what are the glass windows used for by bus drivers curious are they covering themselves from passengers
the driver just took a longer break i got here at 5 51 and watched him leave should have left at 5 56 didn t leave until 6 01
so unfortunate that people are so nasty but cool thanks
15 were at 49 av fs knight clueless of the detour can t a 22 stop to make a sign at least 1 eb bus did not detour too

i thought translink was only for one bus company so i told my mum i couldn t use a go card on a thompsons bus
it s fine that was yesterday just please make sure 2pay attention to the heating system in the old trains thanks for the reply
one zone i tapped in twice cause it said insufficient funds and tapped out once and it still said insufficient fund
is this going to happen tomorrow as well even though i already have a monthly pass
can u2019t even go through your call center
the transit times needs to get there sh t together either there really late or really early leaving 11 min early is crap
always late for work it takes me 15 min 2get2 work but because of the times lately i have to leave 1 hr b4 work c mon now
same problem here i believe i have tapped it out but i may not have honestly don t remember this is annoying
that screen shouldn u2019t pop up when i use it again so what the fuck is the monthly pass good for
charged the 2 75 rightfully so i u2019ve paid my fare since i didn u2019t tap out fair enough but i still have a goddamn monthly pass
so let me get his straight if i don u2019t have 6 stored in my card then my monthly pass is useless right
i fucking didn u2019t i had 3 25 left since i got charged 2 75
is there a reason why your skytrains are never on time
congrats on finally getting verified

not sure i can smell it and when we came into metrotown station i saw someone on the platform smoking

is there anyway to do it a little more discretely
usually a train waiting when 1st millennium line arrives today 10 minute wait for a packed train
exactly some folks at commercial had already given up and went down to the b line before a train finally arrived
that doesn t make it more discreet when you are on a dangerous vehicle

i have been waiting for the skytrain to waterfront for 10 mins now from production stn what is happening

wasnt oops wron lane went from back a few in straight to front of clear marked left then when green cut everyone off no signal
well it s going to make for a super painful commute
now your doors almost closed on a mom and her baby
driver driving 155 bus p3317 is the nicest just made my day ud83d ude04

you re fining us and disabling passes when your system fails to tap us out worstsystemever i m not tapping in anymore

today s front page looks at the problems with the shuttle bus fumes and the legion s annual poppy drive n translink

why is my skytrain beeping
125 it just stopped but was steady beeping from 22nd to royal oak
thank you for speedy reply but today has cost me dearly please update the richmond services directions
135 breaks down at stop 52717 on kootenay driver informs us all and wishes everyone a happy wednesday lolz itsthelittlethings
it s okay most of the passengers got on the next 135 within a few minutes
driver said something about the radio not working
just to make sure the stored value can go towards addfare for 2 and 3 zones on skytrain right
what s the point in having an express 99 bus if it ends up having a 15 minute gap almost every day
what was the arrival gap from 8028 to the bus ahead is that an issue
am i able to bring my dog medium sized white lab on the seabus
umm no i just walk around it because there is 6 open gates
forgot to tap out when i got off the skytrain any thing you guys can do to help easier to remember once the gates are closed
b amp w vancouver day seabus hop from to
lol only slightly creepy lougheedtownctr
but when i ran out of my last balance the gate said stop
mine works consistently
attendant i spoke to said these scanners don t actually work that well didn t take me long to figure that one out
multiple locations at metrotown waterfront and airport took 3 or 4 tries to get it to work
what happened to the 2 50pm 791 from haney place
on hold with right now follow me through my experience vancouver let s see if any of the whining at is justified
when will you start closing gates on the canada line at broadway city hall at times there has been one gate closed

so where s the 190 at stop 51843 that s supposed to leave now there s no alert anywhere on your site has it vanished
there s also a bus stop pole but the driver just told me that he doesn t stop there
that s great but where s the update on your site or twitter isn t that why i follow you in the first place

if i forget to tap out at the skytrain but get on a bus right after why can t it figure out that i m still in the same zone
do people really need to practice opening a gate it just clogs up other gates
do passengers pay for 2 or 3 zones if taking 620 bus through zone 3 and 2 and then canada line through zone 2 and 1
they only pass on things like bus signs needing repair not complaints useless
when is it running up again
if only one dept spoke to another

and for what feels like the 200th time the 5 15 255 doesnt show up at capu ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12 ud83d ude12
a system to inform riders that a bus is missing from the schedule would be beyond helpful esp routes on a 20 min schedule
when does the card get charged the regular fare
is was there a issue with the 26 at joyce just really long line ups more than usual
heads up the bell on b8117 on the 99b line isn t working
i ve got to buy a minimum of 10 in stored value i regret not buying paper fare for nov that way i only pay for what i need
230 w last stop at 23 st driver was just unnecessarily rude when announcing last stop because he had to repeat it a 2nd time
no 3 busses for half an hour during rush hour been waiting at waterfront for some time
do the extended zone same fare deals still exist after 6pm and on weekends for monthly passes
dear woman on bus too consumed with candy crush to notice your stop then blame the driver fuck off that was all you not

must be nice to have holidays in the middle of the work week
does the 07 45 or 08 00 620 trip from bridgeport skip ladner

too long to explain via twitter but i need a rea answer somehow
sorry you have tweeted translink in vancouver bc i think you may be looking for ts
what they told us is contrary to the answer i got from multiple stas hence the issue who else can i call
another day another 2 buses that don t come 3 5 days per week i take this bus they don t show up why do i even bother
first train from waterfront at 7 51 i know it s a holiday but the city still needs to move right
i see we support antitransit sentiment on our bus advertising program
why is the express from horseshoe packed with standing just allowed to sit for 15 mins at park royal south
i forgot to tap out on skytrain today new west to granville stn what should i do
the moment of silence classy marred by some guy yelling at a woman loudly talking on her phone show some respect he said
thx i respect that thoughtful idea would have been wonderful if that was shared with passengers tho who were standing fuming
can i take the 240 15th st at burrard
really no 3 bus for 30 min
any way to fix it
main national but it doesn t matter now bc i ve had to ditch being green using transit and have someone drive me to work
great thanks saw detour online but wasn t sure when reg service commenced
wtf remembrance day crowds amp sunday service seabus bullshit why do i pay for your shit service

thank you i have sent my feedback
too bad translink s idea is to lower service levels apparently increasing ridership not so much
on sunday i was on my way to see my daughter and 2 monkstown busses just didn t arrive freind had same experience mosselly bus
you have sent your tweet to translink in british columbia canada you may want to sent it to rp
thanks sorry about the mix up
please turn heat off in train 231 it is boiling hot in here also are bikes allowed btwn 4 and 6 today
if they aren t there s a huge bike on the train now making it very hard for everyone to board train train 231 expo to kg
where r the trains no train heading to waterfront for past 10 mins waiting at burrard
1 2 any idea why the 5 17 701 coq stn just left haney without stopping at its stop
2 2 he was parked off to the side not at a stop then turned on the bus and left the loop didn t go to the stop so angry
just one more complaint to put in that translink won t do anything about
did the route for the 210 vancouver change it dropped me off on water st and abbot instead of pender and abbott
best route from yvr to granville via skytrain pls thx
would love to dm the details but am unable to need to sort this out
is there anything going on with the 25 bus to ubc tmrw
translink s this bus is a fare paid zone announcement is so passive aggressive it makes me cringe what is it hoping to achieve
how many people take skytrain daily this stat has not been recently updated
how many people take skytrain on a weekday this stat has not been updated for a long time
hey what time does the 129 leave patterson at around 10 10 30 thxs
the train is finally warm enough thank you
i want to know if mr is drunk
hey translink you should be more clear on when busses are running on howe st instead of granville specify which days
as a manitoban i can t understand why anybody complains about the bus system here taking the n10 home at 3 14am awesome thanks
so happy to have left vancouver been going down hill ever since expo 86
i love translink services amp staff but why have a late convenient bus 273 now not stop at dungannon p amp r facility perplexed
translink_ni have a special gift for customers this christmas
nahh sure never worry take your time i enjoy standing in the rain ud83d udc4d ud83c udffd translink
missed the announcement what happened to the skytrain
the train had come to a stop between stations but it s moving now v
i can t use your customer complaint form on my phone is this typical
i love the attendant bitching out people for trying to use a ticket machine that isn t working how about put a sign on it
it s at edmonds old machines one on the far left but your attendant already knows
there is spilled coffee all over the skytrain floor at just left richmond brighouse train 210
you used to have to changed it at the same time they went to one zone only buses
i guess part of the confusion comes from the fact that the fare gates remain open
some folks still need to use up their old school tickets saw one gate closed at cityhall amp oakridge
152 lougheed is a half hour late eta to austin and nelson
so much space but folks choose to cram the doors time to push transitetiquette education overit
retweeted translink translink_ni n nit looks like stormabigail has hit pls expect delays as we approach rush
well played out of 7 working comeonman thishastobeajoke
we are willing to pay for public transit just not with at the helm mark open your eyes
there is a loud and continuous ringing at lougheed station no idea what it is but it s unsettling
do i always carry cash to pay fare so i am not late for work
hey is there a 388 coming standing at 88th and 140th for 20 mins
not sure but we deserve better than what is offering us vancouverdeservesbetter
i didn t see an icon i saw lots of red i m too tall to see from a standing position the are angle for short people
i m a the stop 50078 and the 210 upper lynn valley just arrived late why nobody fix this problem i m tired of complaining
worked everyday fine for the first week now it s every other bus trip it won t accept
the bus 160 was cancelled for about the 10th time this month i think you might as well just take it out of service for good
so annoyed my bus left early this morning rounded the corner for the bus stop just in time to watch it drive by 3 min early ud83d ude21
does it really make sense to send txt alert 2 5 hrs after a bus is late headshake whenyougottabethere
when should the next 22 knight 5130 bus come the 10 26 was early and i watched it pass by
44 is 15 mins late at 50045 finally arrives and it s full this bus is always late
were you able to reset your balance push 0 to speak to a customer service agent
and i see it now
it s okay there was no rush thank youu
that would require unexpected leadership from the bc liberals which hasn t happened in over 20 years
can you tell the 9478 to tell the guy sitting in the front to cover his mouth when coughing
i still can t find faresaver tickets is there any solution in sight
i will never complain abt ridiculous airport surcharge now that i ve seen the feels like i m paying in usd
thanks for sharing translink have a great tuesday insight by
translink wants to hear from you now that it has to find a way to make ends meet without any new funding the story now on
translink people are jumping the bus queue and entering through the back door who to contact about this unfair
i can t seem to find one of those either where are they being sold
check out this link for proposed changes interesting one is changing train bus for 701 to mission city
bus missing again where is the 311 this happens at least once a week whereismybus translink
a missing bus is unacceptable everyone who is waiting for the 311 at 3 40 should get their money back translink shittyservice
translink needs to be restructured reformed gutted before it can be rebuilt into a viable entity
start with a 30 cut of senior management across the board
translink 41 and 43 esp during mad rush am hours 730 9am
root of issues is mismanagement senior execs wallet padding disengaging the public need to gutt amp reform translink
will you guys be closing one fare gate along the canada line
please explain how to make use of fire extinguishers or emergency cabinets at skytrain stations they are in locked cabinets
so break the glass window with my bare hands then unlock the cabinet and the first aid cabinet is still locked
why do have a war against seniors first no two zone fare savers now no credit card to pay the add on
translink skytrain car 331 has super loud car wheels especially for a newer style train
hello is the granville elevator out of service
when is the next bus for stop 51234 thanks
fire the men at the top that take all the money and the staff are over payed
yet somehow reducing bus fares makes total sense
concession has not been available in 2 zone for a long as i can remember stopping the credit card use was a suprise paid double
take one from the canucks and rebuild then maybe funding will be trusted with you
i made a presentation to the translink board july 2013 about fare savers nice to see everything i said was ignored
it s an expo line train
what s going on with the skytrain
is there a problem with skytrain
is there an issue with the skytrain
at waterfront seems to be no trains running just thought i d mention it
rlee 85 proposed bus changes needs your input

if you haven t heard ambulance on site at lougheed bus loop no buses here not a complaint obv just heads up
not once in 2 weeks has a 8 fraser bus come anywhere near on time 20 30 minute waits are the new norm n fix it please
what does think about this idea
for all of you who take the bus remember that the preferential seats are not for you let those who needs them more sit 135sfu
i am aware my point is that it is an ongoing problem fir which a temporary solution should have been tried frustrated
have done so repeatedly still seeing 3 buses in a row then half hour then another 3
at 7pm on the evening show 2 new elex42 polls the survey why you should visit cuba now amp the pronunciationpickle
this is ridiculous
how late is the 129 going to be i am at stop 58342 been here since 6 45 and schedule is 6 50
by old fare media do you mean that the monthly pass will still exist in it s current form
any idea why the c49 got cancelled today will it be back to normal tomorrow
i ve been waiting at langley bypass for the 503 to aldergrove for 30 minutes and it still isn t here what s up

sky trains are operating normally
oct 17 there is a full road closure at production way amp broadway in butnaby 8am 8pm how will it affect 136 route

mt deannatan1 wants feedback on route changes includes newwest routes complete survey by nov 6
mt wants feedback on route changes includes newwest routes complete survey by nov 6
ok i ll keep checking i rely on that bus to get to work and i m assuming there must be some sort of detour thank you
couldn u2019t tap out exiting the 20 just now worried i u2019ll get charged more than 2 10 anyway to prevent this
do you know or perhaps if the proposed j etc routes will be contracted
i m guessing they will i think all the community shuttles are contracted out by
the c9 is not
huh never knew that never listen to a transit blogger they don t know what they re talking about
bunch of progressive anti car jerks
this is why you should arbo that shit first
i will miss the 9 54 bus at bus stop number 55441 because the train was late
just curious why is the skytrain so hot every morning
if i have a pass do i still need to tap out
i really didn t think it was possible i just said a quiet desperate prayer and watched the amazing drivers respond to my crisis
where s the 6 36pm 395 langley bus shittydriver shittyservice newcarcoming

sent an email yesterday regarding a dispute over fare infraction any idea when i d be able to hear back
i lost my keychain wallet on the 555 at 11 15 has anything shown up
got it thank you for the info
did you do a study on the change of ridership from skytrain to buses after fare zone change
and made necessary changes to accommodate or a trial by error company
oh ok so i m guessing it keeps track of the 90 minute trip so i won t get double charged when i tap on the bus
if the trip is during off peak hours will the 3 zone charge only be 2 75
even if i forget to tap out
301 from newton going to be late
1 2 ahhh well that s very helpful and exactly the answer i wanted to hear haha thanks also is there a date set for when

your disabled machines at gateway are once again not taking debit why does this keep happening
any plans to consult with to level the sky train tracks after these are removed will look really odd
whats going on with the 14 and 16
the c25 bus never came or was super late had to drive to the port moody wce stop and pay for parking
what s the point of having a system that tells you when the bus will arrive at your stop when it s not accurate
any chance you can refund my parking since i would have had to if the c25 came
waited 15 mins n the rain for the 135 to sfu and still no sign any eta hastings granville

any reason a 335 east bound would go to guildford and turn around towards surrey central instead of continuing to newton
s7483 first time getting on a guildford only one then doesn t inconvenience me too much but didn t know that was an option
waited 20 min for 135 any reason why 3 buses didn t show
translink it d be great if i could get on a 135 in the morning without having to wait half an hour if i even get on one at all
what is a trolley
is 316 or 319 coming late verylate

cool do you have any links to info about how the technology works though

just got on one thanks i guess
if i don t tap out but immediately tap in in the bus at a transfer does that count as tap out
working hard or hardly working canadalinefail hardlyworking
not tapping out from the skytrain but immediately tapping in in a bus that is an indication that i m out of the skytrain
you need an efficient way of telling your paying customers when a bus is going to be late re routed and or completely cancelled
would be going to see a solicitor this is discrimination and possible sectarianism as well i believe translink
i have some ideas address the cheque to kiernan hedberg
that s the issue email subscription isn t efficient call me on my cell phone and we can discuss business
it should be more personalized what if the customer doesnt have a phone
please fix 25 service from 8 9 am it is often either early late or full this makes it difficult to plan trips

metrotown station there is a line here that reaches the other side of the planet
hi just thought i d ask your opinion about combining c25 amp c26 routes faster and cheaper than removing c27 or rerouting c26

care to explain to me why have been waiting for a bus since 730 when it suppose to come at 737 840 301 newton exchange
near kwantlen university in land some in richmond
i don t think the single tracking from new west to columbia would affect the schedule since those stations are so close together
this isn t the first time this bus comes late this bus is suppose to come on a hourly basis and never shows up
service should not be this reduced at this hour n nolovefortheoddtimecommuter n painful n missedthegame
are my expectations out of line thinknot any trip shouldn t take double the time in off hours n standingwaiting n waitingstanding

when estimates 10 15 minute delays while they perform track maintenance it s probably way too conservative liesssss
just curious as to why track maintenance can t happen after the train stops running i really just want to know
can the trains not remain running outside of their service windows or are they heavily unionized
its still early p u00f6 canadaline skytrain
i understand but could that work not happen simultaneously since only one side of the track is serviced during this interruption
how are you
have to wonder if the problems with the comshuttles is the reason the c24 has been cancelled so many times the past few weeks
got fine and received a really stupid fraction ticket on the skytrain cops are really petty for charging 173 for minor mistakes

is the 25 brentwood still running its regular route
ok literally three busses passed 41 amp dunbar because they were full when each passenger had at least a 3 ft diameter of space
made it lucky legs 11 great start to the day

2 days in a row 15 27 337 bus has not shown up translink bc
an email was sent yesterday detailing it yet to hear a reply asking for specifics
oh sounds very much like thameslink also sounds like equally shite service
surrey central bay 5a today s one came about 10 mins late in the end it was a no show yesterday
a big part of the problem thinks schedule estimate i ask again why even bother
normally clements is one way service this detour will make it two way shouldn t corresponding stops be put on north side
sort of ironic that for the attendants telling people to get tickets at commercial and tap in tap out didn u2019t work at patterson
genuinely one of the highlights of my day is the 352 351 driver that does a recap of the day s top stories over the intercom
put high capacity buses on 143 line from sfu during class end times my commute is long enough already
personally what would make my life easier is cocktail waitresses serving drinks on 99 b line so civilized right
just missed 101 and 155 at 22nd st because they leave at almost the same time brilliant scheduling
hi the c29 scheduled at 4 05 left coquitlam station without stopping for passengers did something happen
thanks today after getting to new west from vancouver fine i find that i now have to pay 4 for a ticket on the train
translink reported to cm some time ago no change thx
seriously i have a paper pass that i ve already payed for the month and you don t give me the option to pay normal rated addfare
when is it rush hour the wait times between trains at approx 430 pm is causing huge crowds especially at granville
there seriously needs to be more busses going up to sfu and down especially the 143 at least once a day i get driven by
thanks for sharing translink have a great thursday insight by

where can i buy 1 zone faresavers everywhere i go they re sold out
the best thing about taking the bus is that u can t get busted for distracted driving
service is abysmal lately add more busses to 44 rte 100s of students lined up late busses pulling away 1 2 full unacceptable
should it bemarked so it is easy to find esp if you have only ever been there one other time i am not i paid the 4 to get home

what of passengers who need both the bus and skytrain what will their fare be come oct 5th
neither of your replies were helpful no trains on burnaby mountain and the bus system can t keep up with public needs
because messing with ppl is fun
i am so pissed off that there are no one zone fare savers to be found
because it s not a monday not a real reason but it makes sense in translink land
so the people that benefit are only those who take the bus how is 5 hat helping
so the only one who benefit are those who take the bus how is that helpful one fare is good all day
since when are computer chairs allowed on skytrain totally have a guy sitting on one in my train haha

it s a joke you can t buy fare saver books anymore i have no change and all retailers in downtown are sold out
two buses in a row gon na make it a third that doesn t come 123 newwest
can you put more busses going to downtown along main street so many going to canada line station timers been at 8min for 8min
are faresavers ever going to be available again it s costing me almost 10 week extra just to commute
what s the eta on either bus 311 or 601 at stop 61327 pls seems late
hey do you specifically train the 352 drivers to drive with all those quick start stops
been waiting at capilano university for over half an hour for 255 or a 239 going past phibbs and nothing where are all the buses

seriously the bus driver is off shift so got us all to get off the bus mid route and got us to wait for the next bus
i m trying to save but i can t do that buying 4 tix all the time what will you do to make up for this shortage
where my 123 bus at 51455
why is there no 323 leaving surrey central
went to three places they do not still out of faresaver
that was not the question you can call and lobby the cities and relevant authority to enforce this rule
c3 fraserview is late long line has formed updates
where oh where has the 255 gone oh where oh where could it be
this is me on the bus right now personalspace
maybe try finding a reasonable solution for your clients
bus stop 50233 now next 3 is not coming after 20 minutes is this normal
at stop 50237 any issues with number 3
thank you do i just go to the customer service office or how can i obtain one
is there track maintenance tonight even with the game and ac dc concert do u anticipate long waits
good 2 know thanks
translink twitter doesn t have enough time to look into or provide anyone with anything but a token i m sorry
where is the 160 at burrard bay 3 my app has said its 0 minutes away for like 10 minutes now
when is the next 50 at 60980
wow that bus 19 does not come very often i should have walked to stanley park instead
oh so apparently cancelled service of the bus 19 until 830pm a passersby told me time to walk
is there track maintenance tonight
what s with the 25 minute wait for the 135 at burrard line s getting really long
we appreciate that you make an effort 2 respond 2 our tweets but does customer service ever do anything with the filed complaints
one finally came just now there was practically a stampede to get on the bus
bus driver v9546 25 is going too fast people with canes are falling before they get to their seats
why is the 3 northbound on main and 17th so delayed 39 mins until the next bus
can i get an eta for the 017 at stop 50080 it didn t show up amp radar app isn t showing it
did really over estimated how many 1 zone fare savers they had in inventory
that s what s causing a bus that normally comes every 5 minutes to take 30 minutes super inconvenient
weird i waited for 30 minutes and then walked all the way to stanley park and saw no 19
why are your bus driver being rude as hell the 25 brentwood was a complete dick told everyone to get the fuck off the bus now
why was there no 709pm bus number 25 going to ubc from brentwood
4 25 pass within 30 seconds of each other i ve now been waiting almost 30mins for the next 25 annoyed
i believe it was 61805 at brentwood station i m on the bus now the next one at 722pm i could have been half way home by now
how come the 403 barely anyone goes on come more often than the 410 everyone goes on during rush hours
these people amp the 10 ppl in front of me have been waiting for the 410 to 22nd for at least 30 mins
did the 733pm 340 get cancelled
ic because there was 2 number 25 back to back that arrived 2 min apart would have been nice if the bus for 722pm left early
driver had to cap the line with 20 ppl waiting in line the bus was already packed prior to my stop
here we go again where is c3 more then a few c8 s and c4 s have gone by
it came 35 minutes later my bus stop was the aberdeen sky train station

broken bus sitting in s cent for 30 mins while we all wait
no one came to tell us or no other bus came
thanks one more question how much money do you need to load in order to be considered stored value
people rely on these services and you can t even deliver a lot of the time for a company who s basis is time
this seems to be a ongoing issue and its get if enough
yah well now i m stuck in rah how over 45 mins late now thanks translink
if like to know what you intend on doing about that
with the amount we spend on fairs why can t we have decent busses who don t break down all the time and show up on time
you can spend half mill bill on art projects and new lines when you can even keep these ones running well
where is the 335 that was suppose to be at 55881 at 4 43
no i m on the 502 the 503 and 2 are in huge traffics which i would have missed and made y appointment if it was on time
i already did and they blew me off
and this isn t just today to be fair not in the past couple days or week but this is frequent
driver for 25 shared warning with passengers leave the phone alone while crossing the street could save your life awesome
they changed and entire bus line in langley without any real notification days or weeks ahead of time in the day and i m late
scrambling to get to the relocated stop
i take the same buses every day i would know if there was notifications before hand
you should e contacting me at this point iv already called and been dismissed with no resolution already
i was told ok we will work on notifying people better next time goodbye great service
will there still be monthly bus passes for october or is that changing with the new system
if you put up digital message boardes at bus loops like skytr with wait times and reports then people can make alt arrangements
hey great job four 100 line up late and all the drivers leave explaining to no one what s up translinkbc
just back from vacation sadly not surprised by nonsense with buses brought on by the ladner exchange construction very poor
hey four 8 lined up at same time and all the drivers leave explaining to no one what s going on keep up the good work 58647
any way you can give disabled access to the second elevators they re ten feet off the platform behind a locked door
it would take unlocking one door and allowing disabled users to get off p1 by security desk a few direction signs wd help
another day another failed attempt to find any prepaid fares faresavers or monthly passes i started last week frustrating
i m talking abt granville station and access from inbound trains 4 disabled the elevator stops at the lobby of office bldg
i left work earlier so i won t be late for my appointment low amp behold the 41 bus makes me wait 30 mins so i m still late
dear more busses to ubc please every september they are over full every year
not sure why couldn t even spare one 41 bus around 5pm 41st amp cambie expects us to wait for 30 mins til the next one ugh
49 mostly occasionally 41 and skytrain
three eastbound 135 buses go by full 30 min wait so far ever think about adding more b lines on hastings during rush hour
have you considered the massive delays that will be caused at stations like scott road where there are only 3 turnstiles
two are open today with one closed for testing and even that caused a slight lineup bottleneck to get in
no needed to get home so i bought a ticket from a different machine
thanks for the clarification i just expected there to be more buses at that time and not have a 30 minute wait interval
gotcha thanks for clarifying
anyway enough ranting about at least it s a beautiful fall day and i m not sick
wan na make a bet i guarantee you there will be plenty of delays and plenty of complaints 3 turnstiles scott road not enough
get your ass together five 135 buses never stopped at victory square two could have easily carried 5 to 10 people
i am only using the skytrain from scott road to surrey central would i still need to buy a skytrain fare
is the october monthly bus pass availble at faredealer uff1f
too bad one of the transit pet peeves wasn t of an old lady carrying bags of empties that make the bus smell like my uncle
thanks uff0cthe dealer kept telling me to check next day u3002i will go to check another dealer tmr u3002
what s going on with the millennium line the train i m on is stuck at brentwood thanks

canada line gate closed
the 8 downtown early evening service is a joke you shouldn t have to wait 45 minutes for a bus this time of day
ohhh so can i go pick them up from today
translink why are there such huge gaps between the 3 main if i miss the bus due in a minute i then have to wait nearly 30mins
it s like that at around 2pm sometimes the buses nb are 35 40 minutes apart and they come in groups of 3
i went pass today after work and man was the line long there s no way there are any cards left if the line was like that all day
the 3 is just as bad i d guess construction downtown better to inconvenience 100s than a private contractor
iwish guildfordexchange is a nosmoking area
thanks so much for the tip i was able to get one from wce
i m tracking the buses online i see the next is in 16 mins but they are always like this it s really really frustrating
why is there a line up of approx 100 people waiting at scott rd for the 319

well actually no the bus was waiting at the back
just wondering why start in october 5 and not beginning of month

20 vic 2572 smells like vomit up at the front
yeah he knows he said don t mind the smell when some people got on all the windows are open for ventilation so
i m not talking for myself i see this often with 145 bus drivers at production station it would be nice to see drivers wait
its the 340 bus but heard roll out doesnt start until oct 5th so first days have to add fare to monthly pass how do i do that
is there a set day when all the faregates at stations are closed
the line was too long over 40 people so i jumped on the train and headed home
i can see the bus and the driver but he s not moving been 20 something minutes already break not ending 410 at 22nd ave
the line is long enough to join the guinness world record nojoke
any track work tonight
you shouldn t have to wait 20 minutes even that is a joke for a city this size vancouver
whoever the old man is driving the 319 needs 2 go over some safety rules like maybe not driving 80km h or slamming on the breaks
share the experience sounds like an ad for an intimate vacation for two instead of a frustrating pain in the butt
i see both buses the 9 02 one just came to the stop no movement from the 9 22 one typical 18 minutes wait
what happened to the 9 04 130 at phibbs exchange
yes but lots of room down along the bus bus drivers need to learn how to instruct passengers better
is the next one still coming that s the last one that goes to phibbs
fyi there s a man at columbia on the eastbound platform who needs directions but struggles with english
so is the 503 to stop 60743 comming

i have a question about monthly pass and using it for skytrain purposes when you go into a two zone do you have to pay extra
for example i buy a one zone month pass and skytrain to metrotown from vancouver

i m sorry if you are not happy with the policy email your suggestions to feedback translink co uk
what the hell is going on with this train at fruitgrove seriously thinking of invoicing translink for my time
out of interest why is the timing stop for the 410 headed south 1 stop past brighouse rather than at or 1 prior 1 2
means a non intuitive speed walk from train away from closest stop to the stop 300m away if bus is early 2 2
try jimmy pattison they re repeatedly touting his role in their pro yes translink plebiscite adverts so maybe he d care
toby email us in and we can look into this feedback translink co uk

a tad early this morning zzzzzz vancouver city centre skytrain station
buses running on moscrop being diverted between smith and boundary in burnaby cbc
no 6 50am bus at stop 61485
what was that m line announcement my commute mix overruled only heard something about service disruption
problems with sky train
if the 341 is gon na be 20 mins late maybe that route should have a bus that comes more often than every 30 mins lateforwork
why is expo trains stalled
do you know what is going on with the expo line getting reports of delays at edmonds
what a great way to start day 326 bus doesn t show up and then sky train is delayed unreliablesystem
thank u my train just moved as u tweeted
too early for delays this morning
is there a train problem at edmonds doors won t open stn platform getting busier
unfortunately we are having an issue with our tracking system today email feedback translink co uk to have this investigated
why is it that edmonds westbound delays are causing slowdowns for westbound trains west of edmonds what gives
is there a problem with the skytrain
heard the announcements loud and clear on train 003
how long is the delay at edmonds i have a meeting i can t be late for
what s the delay
ok thank you for the quick reply
transittroubles with a system wide hold on skytrain because of a problem train at edmonds station
imagine that another breakdown and they want us to give them more money i think not
seriously the sky trains are taking forever and i have an exam
skytrain stuck at edmonds station causing system wide delay the platform is full of people is not making any announcements
and blue jackets show up which they should be at all stations system is a joke
do you know how much longer
we re still sitting outside 22nd st how long will it be 5 min hour this is not good for my job
way to go you fail managing your customer expectations as always and you want 7 5 billion more for this
trains are being moved individually
this is now a regular occurrence with the trains fixskytrain
it s been almost 30mins and they only separated one for the 2car trains the other half is still sitting here
trains stopped can t hear announcements
also sending people to unintelligibly shout instructions from one side of the platform doesn t help either
c mon man stop apologizing just move the broken train out how hard is it skytrain getitright
thanks for the communication at least this is incredibly frustrating
thanks problem train sounds like problem child gettoyourroomnow
it s taken me 20 minutes to go from metrotown to 29th avenue for those who don t know that s 2 stops congratulations so bad
also there has been no announcements in the station can barely hear it thru the broken train window
expo millennium line no trains past edmonds fyi huge crowds on platform
skytrain getitright what a shame
is this in regards to
should ve added that s westbound
is the bus route by smith and fir street disrupted by the homicide at moscrop street thank you
you are unreliable another hiccup on the skytrain making everyone late for work improveyoursystem latebuses brokentrains
hey why no announcements at the stations why the trains are delayed
wow skytrain trouble is a doozy real late this time not sure if walking is better wonder if canadaline has these issues
and kindly get your staff onsite to tell us what s going on getapasystemalready
at joyce station but can t hear announcements can you update screens
wish would share these huge delays with media so users can choose different routing amp avoid mass backlog frustrating
been at edmonds for 5 minutes with no announcements a little info will calm the crowd
i hope someone at has a job where they take those problem trains and give them a good talking to think about what you u2019ve done
i am at edmonds and west bound trains are running through the east bound track any announcements pls
a lot of passengers are moving to the eb stn platform to try to catch the wb train that has been moving thru on that side
skytrain they have announced that problem train has been removed but waiting in each station is still about 10 mins
what is going on with skytrain
why does keep emptying the skytrain at columbia stn this narrow platform was never built as a transfer station
and should we cross over to other track seems trains are going that way
i think that s what they mean when they talk about a train timing out it s off thinking about it s actions
how about making an announcement at stations so we re not left wondering
shout out to for making me late for work u270c ufe0f
staff at columbia need to explain what s going on our train was taken out of service but only 1 2 got off staff said nothing
considering all the skytrain delays transit should be free for everyone for one month
would be nice to have station announcements let those without twitter know what s going on
for 25 minutes and counting
thank you so the bus will still stop at the bus stop in front of fir thank you
why do you suck so much
wow really it s been this long and your still just repeating yourself it s being moved how long do you expect people to wait
send them off to a military boarding school to make trains out of them
trains will be stopping for longer than normal yeah 5 minutes my 10 minute commute has been close to 30
after 45mins finally it s working
we re not mad we re disappointed in you not the train we built you to be
the day i need to be downtown by 8 am there s amp skytrain issues ofcourse
no they put them in tunnels and brick them up like thomas the train
apologies apologies i wish the stinky man crammed in front of me on my packed skytrain would apologize for his stench
yup thanks also check the pa speaker in edmonds stn not one announcement was made in the stn ppl wanted to hear for updates
great job on the announcements and updates over the pa on the skytrain delays
mt on expo millennium line trains are running normally but there will be some delays thanks for your patience da
hurray a dog successfully boarded a 4a bus today in belfast accompanied by a human who was small and well behaved
the day i decide to go to work 30 mins early so i can get breakfast before work decides to delay the trains 40 mins
i just got off the 364 to scottsdale stop 54885 and i left my wallet in the back row 2nd section on the right side
1 2 i was on train before columbia wb during problem train train told was no longer in service amp terminates at columbia
skytrain from kgoerge stn to newwest took 40 mins normally it s 10 mins
2 2 we exit at columbia as directed by control employee at platform tells us to get back on curious as to why the discrepancy
is 129 to gilmore still having detour need to catch it at patterson
ok i ll let them know but honestly there was nothing announced in the station only in the broken train with its door closed
now can you do something about traffic in the east west connector
bike on westbound train 108 really in the way
thanks thought it wiser to stay on expo line than making switch at columbia we will see if it pays off
thank you for updating on tweeter
could not hear at 29th ave station only speakers upstairs were on not on platform
ok makes sense caused a lot of confusion as the moment we arrived train said not in service but still directed back on thx
route 17 special in the morn should terminate at oakridge canada line as it turns east on 41st to take more downtown passengers
they do and it s not a pretty sight
60m for me translink rideralert skytrain customers are advised to leave a little extra time for their commute if taking skytrain da
get it together especially before expecting people to pay more towards your infuriating service thanks
thanks two trains later things were back on their usual tracks and i was on a train all good crowded but good
what s with the skytrain long stops on tracks today
again apologies for the inconvenience if you want this looked into further pls email feedback translink co uk

how hard would it really be for to put wifi on the seabus already does on some busses why not the seabus

i have to wait 40 mins for the next one on the highway in the rain
791 to haney place bus stop 59911 drove past at 4 16
someone dropped coke on the canada line bike car at marine drive station right now huge mess
has this concept been considered in our area
yup the next bus was also early are the bus times changing or are the drivers just super keen
so no waiting at the bus stop if they re 8 minutes early in an attempt to adhere to some sort of schedule then
this happens several times a month and i call to log the problem but it s persistent and often the same driver
maybe something to think about as this is a persistent problem across several different routes
so apparently there s a danger of co poisoning with community shuttle buses now we should tell driver if we see black smoke p
co is colourless and odourless black smoke diesel soot running too rich and different
yep though the driver that said this said there have been cases of ppl getting overcome with co poisining on these buses

everyday at joyce and ubc bus loops i see buses ignore pedestrian right way at a zebra cross walk
they honk and speed up to get people to get back on the sidewalk
maybe if it is such a huge problem for them to get out of the loop traffic patterns should change so buses don t have to yield
your msg has been forwarded to our traffic division

any reason the canada line is so busy on a thursday in the middle of summer

i m guessing it s just a no show
i can see the bus sitting at ubc or is that the 6 56 also delayed
you are the stupidest unreliable piece of shiet ever
that s the only place to buy them bit of a joke no working on sea island has me paying the add fare each time 13 a day fail
anywhere near yaletown roundhouse would help all the 7 11s are out they said that you have stopped printing them

i m leaving from nanaimo and arriving at horseshoe bay tomorrow i d like to purchase a day pass where can i validate it

qr translink have changed thier rules as such please formally investigate and respond you can not change
how can translink change thier own rules regarding complaint resolutions and timeframe
feedback processes by translink ignored or changed qr must take ownership and respond translink guilty
that s not good louise please email all the details to feedback translink co uk so this can be investigated further thankyou cd

bus 19 going to metro town stn skipped few stops on pender st please let it never happen again
why don u2019t inbound trains at edmonds need to do a vobc reset but outbound trains do
no it wasn t that area the driver passed few stns from broughton to thurlow as far as i know he said he did it b c he s late
to switch to the next driver
there was bus 19 going to downton right ahead of this bus so the driver of metrotown one assumed ppl get on downtown one and
would catch up 19 metro one at granville stop without any notice
does the camp involve us waiting around for 4 hours until service is back up
because of his assumption one passenger missed 19 metrotown stn bus
if it s not stopping in every bus stop let us know where it s s little unpleasant having to guess the right stop
why does it feel like the air conditioned cars on the canada line never have it on
rode the sea bus lonsdale quay seabus terminal in north vancouver bc

everyone waiting for the skytrain it starts later than you think on a holiday
as myself and the other 30 people waiting at 29th found out the hard way
pro tip friends don t rely on if you want to make early plans on a holiday
silver lining the customer service agent who explained why no trains were coming was lovely
translink thanks however i mean not impressed with the late holiday schedule very poor
translink lots of people waiting here and the buses are definitely still dropping people off early who are also waiting
translink going to be a packed first train
translink thanks anyway though and happy canada day
expo line going to come through metrotown stn soon
translink any possibility of earlier trains next year on canada day
translink cool don t think i will have trouble doing that
seabus to north van every half hour on a holiday are you kidding me gettingacar
is there a reason for express bus 555 route change it seems to take longer to get downtown from langley
so first 555 out of lougheed broken down on top of holiday hours claps hands never ceases to amaze how inept you guys are bravo
go ahead and waste more time not like they ll give two shits anyway
what times are the last train coming from downtown today with the fireworks later i m worried i ll miss it
is transit free today
it s unpatriotic that isn t free on canada day
to screw the people that s why check in the middle of the month so you don t double charge the people who actually do pay
oh thanks a lot later than i thought it would be
lougheed is my destination anyway but what about from vcc clark to lougheed
why there s no c18 amp c20 until 10am
thank you so much happy canada day to you folks

transit isn t free today o
what about 240 to vancouver i ll need to catch that from cardero at around 8 15 pm any alternate routes
so it s a sunday schedule but the last trains from waterfront will be even more late than on a weekday
so the 79 just not showing today then as per usual bad traffic means translink fuck their customers
what about longer pass times since i ve been waiting for 20mins for a train and my pass will expire before i ve done what i need
the 319 at 10 09 has not shown up at 55197
seriously why not run all of your newer air conditioned trains on days like today not old sweatboxes skytrain
yooooo where s the 106 metrotown bus at it was suppose to arrive 10 minutes ago bus stop 52451 to be exact

do you expect translink to wipe your ass as well
what s going on why are there no alternative routes in place if the delay is going to longer than 20 min
canada line delay is just an example of how unprepared tl is for delays on days of high ridership such as canada day n canadaday
what is the problem
thanks to the staff for keeping those of us on the canada line continually informed skytrain
what is the problem
ohhh okay thank you what bay do i go to
translink really appreciate the excellent communications by canada line staff during delay caused by the police incident skytrain thx

it was 250 east driver said the bridge was closed
do you know where the 320 westbound is from stop 59891 the next one is canceled due to detour
and then the same train that is labelled expo on the signs just went to sapperton notimpressed
has the last 320 passed 59891 yet over 50 people waiting here
is there a detour to braid station via the 159 citadel s been closed
hey fucking idiots there s more passengers on canada day not less
at 55253 now thanks
got it thanks
should we expect any service changes for surrey buses on friday and saturday for fvded2015
i m at sapperton skytrain station in new westminster bc
where s the 97 sched said 9 28 and i ve been here since 9 20 w nothing
it was ioco ungless wb bus finally showed 10 mins late
waited fucking 30 mins for the 49 n it was full 1hr walk from home get your stuff together fuck
cbctraffic not sure where 22 bus has been re routed to from nb knight
any chance to see a 19 at stanley park s bus loop was expected 9 30
so basically 1 hour after it was expected great when you plan your trips with 2 kids this is really funtastic
to encourage more amp more people to cycle it would be great to have a solution that allows skytrain bike transport at all times
if you re going to spam me with ads for sprott shaw at least get the effin bus here on time stop 52061
i am in coquitlam i plan to go to boundary from hastings all the way to 4th ave can i use a 2 zone

learn that word
i am basically asking is there gon na be some zone conflict or something at boundary i really don t want to pay 3 zones
do you know if the 20 is back on granville or still on seymour
regular weekdays like tomorrow i might be taking the 160 in and then transferring from the 160 to the 28 going down boundary
i rely on your services being on time when you fail to do so i have to use other methods cab fare 10 how do i get a refund
i think i found out my answer if i travel down with the 28 on boundary i should be in zone 2 still
apology not accepted too many failures recently demanding cab fare refund whereismymoney
i want to take the 160 on barnet and lansdowne then take it to boundary and get off then take the 28 down boundary to henning
hi guys what time does the skytrain close tonight
i don t want to file bs forms that will be ignored i want my cab fare back who do i yell at
its holiday schedule today so isn t it one zone
alright that is all i needed to know and its for tmrw
okay just looking out for a fellow canucks fan
why are there idiots with bikes on the train when they re banned right now
is the 135 still only running every 30mins or is it more frequent tonight
left my wallet on the 135 en route to sfu just now how can i radio the driver to alert him
get your act together inadequate signage for expo line at waterfront rude and awful customer canadaday experience
so many upset and angry customers at your awfully inadequate signage for expo line at waterfront after fireworks boo
you guys did an awful job of signage many angry people at waterfront re no expo line access terribly rude staff at station
it ll be from burrard to commercial broadway just not sure what time i ll finish work so wanted to check
thanks so far it seems to be zero service however
are the buses running down granville or howe tonight
awful job at waterfront regarding signage for expo line someone needs to be fired
sorry but i m not legally allowed to care
not quite the answer i was hoping for but i understand how it is thanks for the quick response
vancouver gross incompetence with crowd management and signage for post canadaday fireworks waterfront expo line
canada day cluster duck did any one really expect anything different
why just bikes are strollers wheelchairs people with large bags etc all all banned
staff your stations and regulate train load some people can not afford cars and pay fairly for public transit
when is the last expo line from kg to waterfront 11 04 502 never came and now i may not have a way home from work ridiculous
to strand cyclists because you can not manage your customer load is clearly unfair and singles out cyclists
thanks but where is the 502 stop 57138 my text said 11 25 and once again this bus hasn t shown up
fireworks are over but only one 135 sfu bus has come and another is sitting why not have more buses after canada day fireworks
thanks i was at burrard stn it arrived and we re rolling
you should have thought about those better this is the line up for 135 every 20 min wth
to be a fly on the wall of your logistics meeting would be mind blowing the ignorance is insane just schedule more busses
i expect better from the executive team at but we both know that won t happen
still think should call out for the service reduction announcement it could have changed results
way to go running extra buses from on canadaday what an efficiently run company focussing on customer service
way to go running extra buses from on canadaday ud83c udde8 ud83c udde6 what an efficiently run company focussing on customer service
are busses on saturday service as well
quite a few people waiting at stop 54444 for the n24 lynn valley bus that was supposed to come at 11 38 was it delayed
hi m i heard granville station was closed should we look for another
i m pretty pissed this is terrible service on your part having night service be so delayed between buses with this many people
i didn t have an experience today i just find your hard rule policy of absolutely no bikes strands cyclists unfairly
too full next one won t come for another 20 min
you don t penalize or restrict passengers with strollers or passengers on cl with luggage
sorry correction for last tweet 48 more min of waiting thanks
cyclists aren t second class citizens we are paying customers have enough staff on hand to regulate the balance
when does the last train go from granville station tonight
thanks for a shitty ending to canada day
finally got on the third bus for free thanks
bicycles also take up a huge amount of room you re welcome to take the bus or even gasp use the bicycle
all for surrey none for langley and transit info told me to stand at the detour stop even tho it was back 2 norm route insane
no sign of 22 on burrard is it not running anymore
big canada day celebrations downtown but less public transport than a normal wednesday well played ud83d udc4d ud83c udffb

hi has the timetable changed for park and ride to cainshill due to school holidays can t open pdf on translink site
blenheim and broadway one finally came but according to the bus stop number i texted there should have been two before that
doesn t really matter which way it goes does it is going to spend our money regardless
i see i wasn t aware of that i ll just start taking the 4 7 on 4th
thanks for the tweet dale
is this still in effect thanks
understood but failure to tap out has no neg consequence for me individually will be altruistic when not in a time crunch
the street is completely cleared of the accident and all emergency crews are gone
why is the 25 turning down main king ed no signs posted
i really wish i lived in a world were translink was helpful and offered a good service shame we dont
i think i have missed most out of all the things i miss about vancouver fingers crossed for today at 10am
is it possible for all your bus drivers to open the windows on the bus when they start their route it s so hot
did the office in metrotown relocate to somewhere in the mall or is it closed for good
actually the card does work on skytrain and buses just hasn t been released to everyone yet
like i dont have time to stand there and screw around with it im just trying to get to school i miss the old u pass
i came to the stop 5 mins early and i am still waiting for the 8 47 bus at 50715 will the bus be coming soon ___
hello we service all of bc except metro vancouver for yvr please use
i guess even has computerproblems p
an empty 19 just breezed past a group of us at main amp terminal and the next bus is in 11 minutes what gives
heading towards stanley park
it is the proportion of the case load of what tp be a revenue stream for translink and real policing
conspiracy theory are the fare gate security walls gate poorly designed to retain the tp translink
b8016 take your time entering a stop then breeze by when passengers also take their time
loving this old buzzer from 1959 talks about lost property and how an animal skull was turned in
do you know when the fare payment machines at waterfront skytrain will be up and running
why did the train stop for a whole minute at main st science world station going westbound
thank u translink amp 26a driver 4 stopping then getting me thru the madness of the airport road west amp into the city win
victory accountability and oversight must come first at before handing over more public funds bcpoli
yes my apologies on being vague
61 8 tell they aren t trusted
looks lioke 61 to me
yeah you are correct fat fingers
ha it s no nway to go stupid
busta rhymes woo hah got you all in check via
this is good news giving the financial keys to corporate deadbeats at translink is a mistake on so many levels
whilst there are other tools for more funding the results are clear that needs to restore public trust
better budget mgmt by is needed and skytrain maintenance movingforward
in your face transit plebiscite result 61 68 no 38 32 yes
well there s a surprise if the board members can t see the writing on the wall that s what happens
im pretty sure we all want better transit and mobility just not the proposed funding model so what is the plan b
fuck you you fattened porker who wasteth all the people spoke they said no to your porking wasteful excesses you go vancouver
no surprise this is 100 reflective of incompetence is married to a corrupt company

not even truly accountable to the government in reality
love it thank u
what part of trust doesn t not understand now is time for jimmy pattison to really get involved for a makeover
allan you are so out of touch cost efficiency and sound financial management who the hell are you trying to fool
accordingly one would expect that the board of directors should resign in the wake of this
the one coming out of this is we now know you can t buy every election lol
you need to prove yourself worthy of more money and as of yet that s a big no
think of what they could ve spent the 5 8 million on instead of the mindlessly promoting the yes side
people have spoken refund the 6 million to the public translinkfail translinkloses
the 49 bus is late at metrotown it s supposed to leave at 35 i see the driver in the parked bus not doing anything drive pls
your driver on the 401 bus r3291 is coughing constantly she s got a face mask on for everyone s sake please send her home
well i m sure he knew he was late because he even skipped a couple stops with people there trying to rush
bus driver 9545 initially refused a rider w physical disability cuz of segway instead of wheelchair discrimination vanpoli

99 driver headed to ubc currently at alma should do anger management yelling at pedestrians and cars and honking aggressively

well she made it so that s her fault ni trust a million times more than i trust
lined up for 337 15 57 one bus away from the stop nis second pulls in front let s us on bus behind drives off as 337 great
if media did there job the govt and agencies like translink wouldn t be so outta control how bout that
hopefully i think is likely the most unpopular gov funded organizations around
will the 99 be stopping at agronomy amp wesbrook today
have to be open with books and salaries execs cops service alike cant be out of line with real world
come on cc where have you been for the last 5 years
they should take a poll to see how many people don t trust the provincial liberals
is the 19 still being re routed at the roundabout if i understand correctly
nice try but a segway is clearly not a wheelchair or motorized scooter its recreational good on translink
independent transparent audit but that would only work if she followed recommendations hidesherlies
did stop 53761 for 160 move to stop 51869 temporarily no signs on the reg 160 stop but saw one at the 135 stop on hastings thx
why schedule the 188 to depart at 1623 when the wce arrives at 1620 poor planning
i warned them what they were doing was wrong that they were cheating customers they stopped soon after sorry for late reply
i dropped a guitar pick in the 246 bus change catcher by accident let me know when you find it ps it registered as a dollar
it recreational when person depended on it deformity no wheelchair nclearly u discriminate
is it safe to assume the 169 that was supposed to leave coquitlam station isn t coming probably another incident
i just got a ton of emails about the 555 from lougheed cancelled are there any buses heading to langley placestobe stranded
the last 3 literally drove by stop 58125 without stopping now no sign of another one
there was no sign 53761 advising of this how will we know just happened to miss 160 this am amp saw sign at 135 stop
why are your drivers turning away paying customers monthly pass for a full bus when the whole back is empty poorservice

thanks and done it was chaos today getting off the train because of this
i wish had pregnant women in their list of users for reserved seats n
you sure about that ps the line is huge for the 555 right now langleyboundbutstranded
when does the next 555 come to lougheed
do buses have ac it s a million degrees in here
red herring worked shame on him is not a problem
did you guys welcome your newest user creeper pervert hornychubbyboy
the line up here is insane i would add another bus is possible
and thanks for the quick response
what s up with bus 555 the line at lougheed is crazy
like almost the whole loop huge whereisthebus i d even take a school bus at this point last bus left at455 and then nothing
get your 555 busses in order huge line waiting at lougheed every single day for 20 minutes between each bus pathetic
what happened to the 5 04
what s up with the 555 bus to langley
rp just passed by the stop looks like a sign has been posted now
how is everyone supposed to get on that bus
your lineup for the 555 bus at lougheed is massive 150 suggest you need to replace the 512 not cancel it terribletranslink
there was never a 503pm that left lougheed i have been standing here since 455 and just missed that bus phantombus
what s with the delay with the 135 bus been waiting half an hour for a bus that should come every 9 mins
the 5 21 never came
there s a long line at lougheed waiting for the 555 carvolth when do u plan on picking us up longline goodoltranslink
finally 2 buses show at once the line is looping the island at lougheed glad i made a bus but send something for those guys
i just want my mom to come home
the 2nd bus 555 p9202 that arrived at lougheed allowed the back of the line to board all of us in middle of line screwed
nice bus 555 customer service
in case you don t get it that is sarcasm
but you must take clients in order your 521 amp 530 left same time but did not take from same queue 35minwaiforbus
shame just drove past me at the bus stop maybe the shelters should be nearer the stop signs eh
3 nights in a row the 602 has pulled away from bay 6 bridgeport stn leaving people waiting while at loading rude baddriver
they said trains will be held longer in the surrey area what is going on
what was just announced over the pa on the train it was super quiet couldnt hear it clearly
i just decided to go home because i would ve been late for the event by the time i got up there thanks though
translink anything passengers need to know about the delays at the surrey stations just a minute ago
translink thanks for keeping us informed phew on our way then ud83d ude00
guess what the 160 didn t stop at stop 50591 again today what is the problem at peak
looks like a power outage has knocked the escalator and elevator at main street station out of service
wow got picked up by a north van bus thx for making it right today
drivers should turn off the audio announcement of stops if they re a little bit slow as dismissive empl told me on 41
how come the larger bit of the car park at braid has always been closed
are there any delays on the port mann or is there a reason the 555 is delayed
555 to langley from lougheed delays expect delays to your onward journey any updates
does stored value cost the same as faresavers i e 2 10 for one zone
the 555 lineup at lougheed it s looped round the small building and done a 180 what is going on
what s going on with 555 massive line at lougheed stn
expect long delays then
we are running out of sidewalk here this line is insane for 555 def not running every 8mins
well this is a useful distribution of b line busses s
trains are stuck at scott road for the past 5 minutes any reason why
the lack of consistent service for the 555 during rush hour is unacceptable this is not a one off
broken train at scott road door on 215 was jammed
what s the reason for so many 555 buses being canceled today amp is it possible to send them more often to relieve the lineup
where the 99 eastbound the line is starting to extend in the broadway city hall station
attendant is here now at scott rd
glad to see a 555 driver enjoying a smoke break watching the line instead of moving customers
cancelling a bus during rush hour isn t acceptable for a commuter service this is the only bus to langley
i see that thank you we are moving now
your logic doesn t make sense if it s a 10 minute service ms only one bus is cancelled how have i just waited 40 mins
i ve noticed this happen a few times since the route change the buses just after 6pm fail to show and a backlog builds up
channels howard roark in front of bike lockers in
thanks for the clarification will rates in the article be implemented once a full roll out happens
cancellations are often unavoidable however on a 10 min turn around 40 mins is a real stretch letting us know would be good
oh no worries i just wanted to get it out there thanks for the quick response
extra busses is a good thing having over 100 paying customers feeling stranded isn t good information is king make us like u
of the dozen or so translink staff on the floor only one mentioned in passing that a bus was on route no other notifications
i will subscribe now although i like most of the people in the line were in the dark a quick shout out would have been ideal
i believe translink has a service for people with mobility aids that do not easily fit on buses heard of handydart
what bus goes to 7350 edmonds st
thanks everything turned out okay though still no word on what was the reason for the canceled trips
new west or metrotown
ah that s why this bus looks different too bad they missed my 156th street stop
segway can go into handydart why can t same rider use regular bus why encourage segregation inclusion
nyou just contradicted yourself by acknowledging segway as mobilityaid nclearly you discriminate
as the rider was part of a high school summer camp bus driver eventually permitted segway on the bus
nthey called it the batemobile but that s probably been heard before nwe just need responsibly and open meetings
interesting thanks for the clarification how do rider depended on segway get to destination n physical disabilities
nrefusing service to ppl w deformity physicaldisability cuz they use segway humanrights n ctvvancouver
so the c73 bus at 55607 atop was supposed to come at 8 01 it said online amp by text it came at 7 52 why are the time always off

waiting for a friend bus service is so shitty in my neighborhood would have been faster to drive coquitlam to downtown

15 minutes to get from stadium chinatown to main science world couldvecrawledfaster
fuck you delays due to shitty fucking mgmt
commuters are not sardines
don t want your excuses just want to get home
you re either part of the problem or part of the solution guesswhichoneyouare
you fail to run trains for several hours every night do your maintenance then this is inhuman
chinatown to nanaimo 20 minutes that s just unacceptable
seriously 30 minute wait for a train after an event that is a joke
25 minutes later still in zone 1 still on a packed train too
this is a compete joke 10 mins with the doors open at stadium this is unacceptable
best part is when you finally leave only to stop short of main st
i think we are on the same train this is a joke
seriously the only thing in bc worse than you in this province is
so you also enjoyed more people getting on at metrotown

final thoughts of the night i love amp will continue to love public transit is the only thing that makes me doubt that love

translink during track maintenance do you extend the time on our transfers or we just eat it

so our trains just came apart between rupert and gilmore
why did the eastbound expo train at renfrew come to a sudden and violent halt we re all sitting here wondering
what s going on with millennium line it keeps stopping for no reason no announcements either
i m guessing we re the timed out train the second and third car split the guys just showed up to get us moving though
timed out skytrain is causing delays this morning expects delays to be less than 10 minutes
i m gon na miss my bus
the 791 from braid leaves in 9 minutes stuck at rupert
any idea why my eastbound train is being held at renfrew station
whichever skytrain cs is on the eb platform is being fantastic right now with explaining the situation

why are the trains sooooo packed this morning was there an issue earlier
an empty train at commercial would really help the 300 people who can t get to work on time this morning
wouldn t it be great if the expo line was designed to deal with 2015 capacity in 1985 sarcasm dealwithit
if you can send one empty train that would ease the insane congestion where are those two compartment trains
an empty train would help commerial
why is it so busy huge line up at commercial drive

skytrain customer service advised that delays due to track maintenance why not maintain after the last trains run
hey i m on skytrain at stadium heading to scott rd can you move this fvcker
back on the skytrain crowded
what s the hold up now been 10 minutes at each station love a 30 min ride two stations away
thanks for reply now stuck at nanaimo crowded typical
how much longer is this power rail maintenance going to last monthsalready
is there a detour for bus c18 amp c20
btw it helps to apologize when there are delays whataconcept careforyourcustomers
why is the train not moving at nanaimo station ud83d ude12
it seems to me that on weekdays and saturdays that there s still a lot of commuters on the skytrain at 9 and 10pm 1 2
basically what i m asking is why can t this work be done when there isn t a high volume of people
apologies ruefully accepted i just want you to know that this rail work is the current bane of my existence ohm
i think this scheduled maintenance should be scheduled after the skytrains stop running makes more sense
why do i see ppl traveling with their bikes in crowded skytrain at rush hour from dt eastbound two days in a row
bikes are not allowed 4pm to 6pm from dt eastbound right why don t skytrain workers on platforms pay no attention to violators
all this maintenance for what i don t see any improvement
turn on ac in car 233 i m dying of heat lol

is the elevator at waterfront station working
i have been standing in the rain at stop 53485 for 40 minutes and two scheduled buses where is the 152
realtalk would it be cool if for every two scheduled buses at least one of them showed up that s like 50 that s barely a pass
oh and scheduled bus time 3 has came and gone as well here s hoping it s just late not mia
this isn t even a rare occurence though like the 152 which i take twice a day m f has in my experience a 68 success rate
this is not a joke i have literally collected data on how many times the bus has shown up on time
also i counted success as shown up within 5 minutes of scheduled time so 68 is already generous
what happened
wait wait why is it my responsibility to report missing buses
don t you have accountability metrics in place to make sure that oh idk more than 30 of your employees show up to work
quick question are half the 10 buses on holiday it certainly feels like it these past few days

good to know but perhaps you could add some signage as i specifically parked there to stay out of the way of the day bus stop
much appreciated system showed no reports caught the 10 25 bus and that is the one that has broken down

144 and 6200 block waiting for 341 to guildford
nvm its here thanks anyways translink
is there any particular reason why the driver of 99 bline b8089 nwon t open the back doors for people to get on
the issue is that he s choosing not opening the doors so people can get on is that not the reason for 3 lines at each stop
the doors work he s just choosing not to open them so people can get on people are opening the doors so others can get on
doesn t feel much cooler in 323 expo to kg
any detours for the 24x or 25x buses heading east on georgia from north shore

some1 needs to keep a better eye on temps outside amp ac levels on trains all day shouldn t have to request ac on daily basis
it actually happens quite often at the ubc loop but not every stop like today

interesting about shuffle is it puts ministers in charge of hot button issues of liquor distribution and cbc
was always strange having kamloops mla dealing with has better hands on experience cbc bcpoli
christyclarkbc shuffles cabinet out of education to community sport amp now oversees cbc
no bus at 9 38am at stop 53569 why and there were others waiting there long before i arrived they ve since decided to walk

time for someone else to carry the crap load that is minister stone carried more than his share next bcpoli
out of nowhere
time for someone else to carry the crap load that is minister stone carried more than his share next bcpoli
curious definition of makes sense
fassbendermla is now minister of community sport cultural development and minister responsible for
as in is metro van specific while the minister now formerly responsible lives in riding served by bc transit
certainly gives as minister responsible for new challenges focus on gov to be highlighted
remaniement ministre de l u00e9ducation bcpoli remplace qui sera entre autres min resp de icicb
welcome to the party please work w amp on integrated transportation vision amp plan
let s hope is as stingy with as he was with education bced bcpoli
yes i understand twisted logic by which this change is being justified i am just suggesting it is nonsense
because he did such a good job with education sarcasm intended
great to see back on the file with peter u2019s hard work amp eternal optimism hopeful we can all move forward together
peter fassbender in charge of i m surprisingly ok with this hopefully he s an even bigger dick to them than he was to bctf
hmm can t possibly make any worse can he
i just saw an old man running for the 100 bus at the bay at 22nd street skytrain station and the bus driver pulled away
cknw he already knows how to dismantle something education so get ready translink folks
i was standing in front of the bus pointing and the bus driver wouldn t open the door for him disappointed badservice
will be interesting to see bring into the affordabilityzone bcpoli
pattibacchus does a new inexperienced minister of education signal status quo for awhile
hahahahahaha good luck with that one mr fassbender u being punished for something
it s like they re run by incompetent
stick it to the consumer again lower rates more use morenwesttraffic
welcome to the fire fassbender
what s up with skytrain service seems like infrequent service or delays
any idea when can we expect train to vancouver at gateway been here for 15mins already
if you want to get somewhere take if you want to get somewhere on time drive a car
live report from metrotown nothing moving here either may need to jump in car
well that s just fucken awesome woo ud83d ude0a

any plans to make a bus bridge b w columbia and scott road
if some trains have service is the wb train at metrotown able to start moving to the waterfront
is it just me or are skytrain cars breaking down almost daily now i swear i read about a problem every time i open twitter
fuck you and your shitty service pathetic
have you tried turning it off and then on again itcrowdsupport
at it again reliability 100 yay
shouldn t translink provide a bus or some kind of transportation between columbia and sapperton or columbia and new west
per no eta on a fix for the skytrain issue but adds it shouldn t be long
i m at columbia area on the train are we going to metrotown
windows 3 1 rocks

b line toward commercial broadway not running no buses in over 15 minutes now
how long is the delay
is sorry enough apologizes after bus driver refuses to help 100yo woman
this is only one incident seen many bus drivers go out of their way to help elderly handicapped on and off the bus
great question certain that affordability zone for translink will higher than bced afford zone
older people should be given common courtesy and given assistance the driver was not kind or caring
i m going to be late for an interview because the 325 decided not to show up
you have a tremendous amount of grumpy drivers lol personalityscreening
and to mark the occasion more delays
fuck u now i got to sit out here in my all navy work uniform for a half hour
what s the eta on trains running again
silly choice of photo all of buses are barrier free no stairs
on 8 am cbc news spokesperson encouraged 100 yr old to file complaint typical of them can t they reach out to her
and if the driver got injured for lifting the walker would she had been covered medically
has done anything 2 contact mary anne cooper is onus on her 2navigate complaint system learned nothing frm
thanks to cbc for posting her name amp picture have to lead by the nose
he ll ignore it and pretend he has memory problems fassbendover buyabikeyouwillneedit
your bus drivers need to be easier on the braking amp accelerating someone could lose their balance amp fall
will be very interesting to see what does now as minister responsible for on governance amp funding bcpoli
woodfordcknw980 they shud and second toll on tc btween kensington amp willington and split toll 1 2
someone found it and was able to call my banker because i had an appointment card with it and he contacted me to let me know
2 at portmann 1 at willingdon pick up that poco coquitlam revenue who use improved hwy 2 2
because finding a decorated 100 year old woman in metro van is so difficult i hope the driver is proud
are the buses in poco still being reroute because of the fire earlier translink
or take out the hwy portion of debt from bridge toll and reduce toll tobefair
please thank mr for their assistance this morning when i was freaking out about losing it
it s things like these that make me think twice about s performance this isn t the way
i m at phibbs bus exchange in north vancouver canada
weak the driver could have lowered the ramp if they re that lazy
a whole lotta nothing or a lot of damage same end result paying 4 self serving polis bcpoli
i thought they said it was medical issue that s what they announced on the train
is there any issues with the 101 bus going from 22nd to lougheed
what does age have to do with this rulesandregulations handidart
mary ann cooper 100 was denied help by a driver to lift her walker onto a bus learn why
2 17 at stop 52261 never showed
do you know why it s taking so long for the 401 no one road bus to get to minour
oh for did anybody learn from last summer s breakdowns open a window people it s not that complicated
can you explain why that caused extra hour delay when attendants not in place to manually move trains for 2 hrs
tonight proved that getting home from downtown vancouver when has skytrain issues is an exercise in frustration
free rides for a week
get your shit together fed up
i would to no fricken way anyone should stay stranded on a hot skytrain it s like leaving your pet in a vehicle
do i get a refund for the pass i purchased today but didn t get to use because of the breakdown
that was a commute from hell today yo gon na give people a couple bus tickets again does no good when i buy a monthly pass

why did the 26 bus leave 29th ave stn 10 min early
i m at bus 405 cambie five road in richmond bc
free rides for a freaking month after todays commute
p u buddy stuck d t caught a bus thought going to metro nope got dropped joyce was going to walk to edm hadlostallfaith
trying to find some information but can t see anything posted wanting to know cause of skytrain shutdown is it age
would love to hear from folks on one of trains that customers broke out of how long after it stalled minutes hours
must see n
not disagreeing she u2019s been commenting for tl quite a lot lately i honestly think she u2019s working there now
expo line getting line replacement tonite just curious
thank so much appreciate it hope we can get it resolved i m sure more than anything you guys want this fixed and behind you
this needs to stop
this is why translink is a mess stop blaming customers and look in the mirror there you will find the problem
of course is going to put the blame on others if they hadn t broken out they d be dealing with bodies
did they expect people to sit roasting in the compartment or have a stab at staying alive with fresh air
you have to seriously consider the safety issue when it comes to skytrain
when is take your kid to work day staff should be forced to ride skytrain then mommy why i m i a skyhostage
they don t now they re blaming delay on passengers it s like would you rather ppl break out or bodies in morgue
handling the twitter account must be one of the most stressful jobs someone in socialmedia could ever have
if they did cause extra delay charge them
blame passengers for real how low will they go
2015 almost monthly breakdowns n christyclarkbc should donate the omthebridge to translink amp relocate yoga day to the park
while is apologizing for latest skytrain meltdown it s also blaming some customers for additional delays
while is apologizing for latest skytrain meltdown it s also blaming some customers for additional delays
people have been told over and over and they still don t listen
as frustrated as i was earlier i m thankful for the bus drivers who busted their butts to get droves of ppl home
free ride home from concert thanks i m not mad anymore justkidding bffs
it is ridiculous that on all of no mention of this url
2 sounds like it took over two hours to get service restored blames 3 people breaking out of trains for the excessive delay
so did they fine anyone for walking like they said they would do or just another please don t do it
i wouldn t be thanking people for something most of us don t have i have no more patience for these disruptions
yeah has a lot to learn
is sky train still down
thank god broke down today so that i can get home 1 5 hours later than usual said no one ever
how hot was it indoors
fuck translink and they want more money after how many skytrain shutdowns
finally getting home after waiting out the skytrain debacle again what incompetence at vanpoli bcpoli
skytrain should shut their mouths need2restructure this garbage operation epicfail bcpoli
any bets there will only be a free day to make up sucks when you have no vehicle to get around this is almost a regular thing now
big difference to ground response at edmonds twitter team as usual stellar and they trained the ground staff well this time
make the guideways accessible bladderbuster nazicattlecars don t shift the blame anne u transit noway
what s up with this today ouch
interesting i was there both nights and concert tuesday started at exactly same time as sunday cknw translink
fines should be issued
please recognize this bus driver for the experience we had and randomly heard about are amazing steve bawja
please don t get broken on the 11th please
left a little early but got too my class only 10 minutes late not too bad at all
mt today was another good reason why we dont need skytrain expansion until we fix what we have
just understand that the system is getting old so it s going to stop working more often
patricia why is it so difficult to find a contact number to ring translink
burnaby transit centre
can you purchase a day pass on buses thanks in advance

if i buy a day pass how much will a return ticket from waterfront to mission on the westcoast express cost
no problems reported this am but update on long delays on skytrain last night expected at 8am live at waterfront
so what will u do for monthly pass holders to compensate for all the train trouble a free transit day is useless to all of us
bus 555 has gotten off hwy 2 westbound and is on 104th why

we are drinking the kool aid kd

why is there no bus that just goes up and down 200th st from port kells to brookswood simple all this exchange crap c mon
so we re slaves to your lame planning then you cancel a bus my girl has her 1st points against her at her new job now
who are they gon na fire or blame this time
we re live with colleen brennan skytrain
she has to stay an hour later tonight so the family suffers too why is this system allowed to run this way i hate hate hate you
sense from users is free day won t be enough to make up for problems want to see money go to fixing mechanical issues cbc
i m at west coast express maple meadows station in maple ridge bc
okay you got this
we were in mission last night and talked about taking the train there one day oh well
wan na know what would be great if could get there shit together so i can get to work on time
we had interview scheduled w translink at 7 45 we re told running behind w other interviews we re trying to reschedule cbc
commerial stn escalator out for weeks elevators down random system wide breakdowns remind me why we bother paying fares
555 westbound taking coquitlam exit before bridge to avoid jam presumably lougheed to brunette smart
if a service fails to do what it s supposed to do how is a refund denial justified
what would really give me peace of mind is if spent her omthebridge money on improvements
we hope to connect with at 8 10 on yesterday s skytrain shutdown cbc
should look at other cities that use a similar skytrain system e g transit
ha expects someone from on the show about shutdown but they re running a little late no pun intended bcpoli
how long is the free service
what the heck happened on skytrain this time gets an update from following massive delays
what the heck happened on skytrain this time gets an update from following massive delays
not the morning to be late i think that was the reason you were being interviewed
there is no free service today is there
we have colleen brennan on the line cbc
transilnk trying to determine exact cause of shutdown we know trains lost communications w control centre brennan cbc
as i stepped on the 502 surrey central station bus at 7 52am stop 55355 the driver abruptly put his arm in front of me
dear get drivers on those trains
translink not offering free day of rides this time around because shutdown was 2 1 2 hrs compared to 6 hrs last time cbc
and said next bus there was room for more atleast 4 more people before the safetly line that was rude more buses please
hey there can u give me a eta on the c3 it s super late
hey thanks for checking i know u have no control but this bus is always late ud83d ude14
skytrain cars packed to gills stuck on tracks indefinitey w doors shut hot day of course ppl pry doors open
is the text system down
7 shutdowns since last summer how about an accounting of construction accident closures and congestion for roads
free day doesn t help monthly pass holders can i get a gift card instead
the bus came at its usual time 61040 but just out of paranoia i wanted live times and havent been receiving times fido
is the 19 to metrotown delayed been waiting at bus stop 51370 since 8 30 but nothing till 8 42 lateforwork thanks
didnt work for either 61040 or 58501 times are supposed to come in within 3 mind right s
time and time again thales has proven itself to be a leader in fare collection technology
colleen brennan nous n offrirons pas de transports gratuits ni de remboursements u00e0 la suite de la panne de skytrain hier icicb
1 2 colleen brennan explique que le service a pu u00eatre r u00e9tabli en 2h30 mais que cela aurait pu u00eatre r u00e9duit icicb
i got this
if google can produce a self driving car why can t implement a train that at least gets to a station when there s a problem
translink still doesn t know exactly what caused yesterday s rush hour skytrain shut down although it was a technical issue
so you offer a day pass how does this help people who buy monthly passes we will still be charged full price when we buy
translink hopes to have more information about skytrain shutdown later this morning will share info as soon as it s available
les responsables de vont se r u00e9unir pour comprendre l origine de la panne d hier et mettre fin u00e0 une s u00e9rie d incidents icicb
there may ve been a tech issue yest w the skytrain bt pls tell me why your 99 ubc driver passed everyone today w a spacious bus
yet another delay preventing us to get where we need we need you
thank you for your acknowledgement
translink we re quick to criticize transit but won t question the status quo of daily road congestion wasted time energy
translink still doesn t know exactly what caused yesterday s two and a half hour stoppage on the expo line crews still working on it
god i love it when a bus driver doesn t look at his stop and drives by me without stopping
skytrain not reliable enough time to have human drivers for this aging system
what should i do i start on a bus and i will be needing an all day pass then can i upgrade a 1 zone pass at kiosk
latest on skytrain shutdown still figuring out what caused it
between vancouver and toronto one wonders if it was deliberate action
lol more reviews and more s pissed away when is enough enough bcpoli bullshit
what s going on with the morning schedule for the 27 it s been two days in a row where it s been short a bus from 9am to 930am
what s gon na do for its customers this time another day of free service and nothing for monthly pass holders
because if you want 29 year old infrastructure to stay operational you need to do work
i think it s time to turn on the ac on the trains a packed morning commute not comfortable at all
many people were disrupted and simply we need to do better to meet their service needs doug allen
you need better communication amp staff who are not annoyed when ppl need help with directions when your services shut down ud83d ude12
i apologize for what transpired doug allen
translink why are you changing the destination point for westbound 555
induction motors iow core drive system failure that s not comm as prev reported
translink is once again apologizing to commuters latest newscast june 10th
translink is once again apologizing to commuters latest newscast june 10th
translink so then what s the estimated added time to trips the offramp is complete then
my my allen amp toronto ttc s byford head desk head desk eyes rolled
thank you for the periscope
so if you have a trained operator on each train just in case it happens again could he not check for fair evaders
ok well if there is a special off ramp then that shouldn t be that bad 2 min is ok compared to 10 15 with no offramp
get to trains early same response gives most of the time when asked about a problem issue
translink the periscope feed for the status update about yesterday was a nice touch thanks for that
l ancien pr u00e9sident du syst u00e8me de transport de toronto gary mcneil attribue la note c au temps d intervention de hier icicb
doug allen vice pr u00e9sident de n est pas satisfait de cette note et esp u00e8re beaucoup du personnel en surcro u00eet d u00e8s ao u00fbt icicb
you mean the intention is for buses only p
also what happens to eastbound do we still board at braid
so if another system wide meltdown doesn t strand our hosts today we ll record this evening send in your questions askftbl
motor that failed installed in jan 2012 translink engineer train timed out after sound wave alarm went off
martinmacmahon live at 10 33a w details as gets a c from the man in charge of reviewing the system
doug allen on ne peut pas bl u00e2mer un syst u00e8me de transport pour seulement 2 incidents techniques ces derni u00e8res semaines icicb
so it was col mustard in the skytrain with the induction motor clue
how do i get the update if i don u2019t have the app
man behind independent review of gives system a c transit authority apologizes
free transit day getting reimbursed what a joke 2 tickets are useless when i still have to buy a pass
and again skytrain fails i called it when it happened the first time you can t be surprised
i didnt wait too long but i was late for school amp missed a quiz thankfully im allowed to write it later error in feedback link
i think the pole for the r7393 bus at back exit is broken it moves like its loose
translink theres an agressive panhandler at canada line waterfront station at the top of the stairs
shutdown response gets c from skytrain troubleshooter reached 15 19 stuck trains within 20 mins
yay back to normal
i think the pole on bus r7393 is broken at the back exit
when is the elevator at h20front going to be fixed seems like a week now i ve managed w my escalator skills but others not so
i see what you did right there chuckles
no refund no answers for passengers stuck in shut down nothing i was stuck for 2 hours notcool
taking the skytrain is so risky and exciting now will i make it to my destination will i be trapped for 3 hrs who knows
sorry i apologize it s the elevator to street at vancouver city centre i am so use to listening to the nxt train is for h20frt
ok good to know thanks
skytrain aren t you getting sick of apologizing yet get it together lower your wages and fix the system
does anyone know when skytrain will break down today so i can plan my trip home accordingly
icymi we spoke to colleen brennan about yesterday s skytrain shutdown n
hi where s the 155 from braid to 22nd
fyi 4 conservative trains grind to a halt and stopped for a good 2 min each when departing kg towards wf
you should be offering a free month of service with all your latest screw ups what s the excuse next the sun skytrain transit
you might wan na reroute the c53 as it affects that route a little bit unless you have hober busses ud83d ude02
skyhostage challenge idea translink executives to be in a skytrain in blistering heat for two hours are you game
skytrain well as long as he s pleased seriously fix the system
i don t care about free transit fare but can you pay for my overage costs for my phone data i get bored waiting for you again
great visual shane share the road
great visual shane share the road
waiting for 160 vancouver at coquitlam center for a while just checked the wait time and it went from 13 min to almost 30min
yes i am and i think everyone made it to production station safely
fails us again low security park and rides you have to pay for and in turn your car gets robbed of necessary parts ud83d ude20
any idea what happened to the 1302hrs 160 to vancouver from coq station
i m actually happy that all the trains stop when there is a motor issue on one collisions injuries derails skytrain
none of the machines on the hastings entrance to waterfront are working for debit or credit fyi
awesome thanks for letting me know
they change the time for bus stop22765 in 156 102ave in guildford it never came at 2 18 pm yesterday
can t believe i had to walk home from joyce to metrotown in 30 degree weather yesterday fuck you
soup of the day apology steal f up f down etc etc
resign asshole nobody should use that over priced unreliable service take191bus from kipling 3bucks
ahead on w amp admits it must do better after yesterday s skytrain shutdown
how can a lim failure on one car cause a system shutdown when every car carries redundancy one reason i am back to driving
no 601 to bridgeport yet from hwy 17
yup and it just came thanks tho
bcgov should restructure skytrain immediately epicfail of a system indeed neverends
i have been waiting 20mins on mary st at edmonds st but bus is not cominggggg urgh i am late for my work thank u translink
hellloooooooo what is wring with 106 bus that goes to metrotown station i have been waiting for 30mins omg
i saw 2 buses that goes to new west while i hav been waitingg
one passed just now but it hassign nis omg everyone is pissed
why fare check a bus when you usually need to buy a fare or present a fare to get on said bus
yes i just got the bus what was the problem that they were late the buses supposed to come at 10min 20min and 30min
is the escalator at patterson going to be back in service today
sad to see security in numbers boarding busses downtown looking for fare evaders right after boondoggle on skytrain yesterday
is transit free today
how long will construction take at new west station
ck was much nicer than bk
thank you i ll continue calling incompetence
want get more followers my friends n u27a1 u27a1 u27a1 followme followback
maintenance car 592po just drove through the crosswalk on a red to back up outside comml bway w exit as i was going through cwalk
you are all heroes n n heroes
sfu 145 broke down then skytrain translink is making us walk to school home healthy initiative exercise
westminster hwy east of 6 road has been shut down by police
so you screw up my day for 3 5 hours yesterday and you don t even give us a free pass for the day pathetic vancouver transit
we ve had driverless trains in the sky since 1985 i expect disruptions to such a thing trains in the sky since 1985 well done
someone spilt coffee on the skytrain and its a bit of a hazard if someone could clean it that would be great 314 d d3
will it be safe for me to actually catch the train from bursts station to metrotown today or am i having to reroute yet again
can we get some sort of fines or charges to the idiots delaying everything by breaking out of the trains fucking unbelievable
pt fact of the day seq real time info update gt ptfact
is there something going on with the skytrains today eastbound
is there another skytrain issue i ve been on the patterson platform for over 5 minutes and there is no train going east
been waiting 20 minutes for a bus that is supposedly arriving now relying is almost enough to make you move out of this city
the fare validators aren t working at surrey central they re only printing the date on the end of the ticket
pretty sure the bus driver for the 33 around this time of day is the best ever sooo friendly every day
any particular reason for the switch seems like the trip will be longer commutetime
hello its time for my usual is the power line replacement on tonite or not question
why the 555 change bus trip longer slower skytrain to downtown now either longer or requires transfer
eb hwy 1 stop go from at least brunette hov getting through fairly okay yay 555 bus
145 drivers seriously need to enforce getting people to move to the back unacceptable that the entire back to of bus was empty
aaand another not full bus went by i guarantee filling that form does nothing for me it s been like this for years
skytrain only 3 minutes longer assuming transfer at crazy busy broadway station goes well bus trip to lougheed will take longer
how do you validate a fare saver and an add fare ticket on the bus
realize lougheed might have been original plan but that doesn t necessarily make it a better plan what s the advantage here
gets c grade for response to yesterday s literal skytrain melt down a motor under a train melted latest on
why does the 19 leave stanley park loop headed back downtown empty when there s this many people waiting
thank you for your continued efforts to reassure me that no matter how expensive vehicle ownership is it s completely worth it
longer bus ride longer train ride and more traffic into what is going to be a busy hub gobacktobraid
mva at hastings and alpha intersection east bound traffic is 2 lanes instead of 3
is there some sort of express transit interchange access to lougheed otherwise it s just replacing one delay w another
where is 239 at stop 54411 was supposed to be here at 5 26 pm according to schedule
are there extra buses in the cloverdale for the surreybc canada day event
it s here great thank you
majority of customers not going downtown cause that s where i m going amp highly doubt this will be faster
last 257 for an hour and it leaves 10 minutes early ridiculous schedule made worse great stuff
also adds extra loadings unloading to already extremely busy broadway station even more people will end up being passed by
my haiku once a month stop and think break in translink
my haiku once a month stop and think break in translink
please fix your payment terminals esp at lansdowne stn debit takes 5 or more tries my card works elsewhere
is there a anywhere i can still be able to buy a monthly pass i lost mine already
thank you i just filled it out fyi kudos to the driver on bus 2252 for dealing with the overcrowding he was left with
what time are bikes not allowed on skytrains
congratulations to for going 1 day in a row without a skytrain outage
played roulette today actually arrived at my destination miraclesarereal
you send me a form to complain about the c3 always being late that link did not work the bus did not even show up today
you need a human operator on each train and get rid of 35 000 00 per month dougallen
i included it in my complaint
to take the 555 do we go to lougheed starting now or when does that start
i know you all have no control but the c3 def takes naps on its way and decides not to show up it s frustrating ud83d ude21
i think your end time in the pm needs to be extended to include upto 630pm it s still peak rush hour
packed train leaving stadium amp a man pushes his way on with a bike taking up room amp no transit person around
a shoutout to a bus driver is always great to hear
hearing the accident on westminster hwy is cleared now
when is the next 20 from 60993
have you also noticed that the text response has been i m well unresponsive it often takes 3 more tries now
is there a public translink gps app available
thank you on it now
train 068 has a really weird vibration in the floor might want to take a look at it tonight
hi i m on the 502 bus and the bus is stopped at fleetwood way and i m trying to get to richmond
i m trying to get to

thanks and have a good evening
no problem thanks for padding it on it seemed worse at high speeds fyi
loved your joke about the interview with translink that they were running behind no pun intended
translink someone forgot their key on the southbound 8 bus around 7pm

someone filmed my daughter having a temper tantrum on the skytrain this evening without my permission what shoyld i do
if can t afford to pay more staff to have on trains why can t they just cut some salary for vp s to help with the cost useless
can blame me if they want not hard to take me to court go on i dare you gloves are off

246 did stop a couple of minutes after which happened to be less empty that the 240 previously
kudos to the driver of bus 2274 who squeezed in everyone who was waiting and told people to move back not using the recording
its been running for a few months bit early for it to need new parts no when will you have an idea of how long it ll be out for
has there been a change to frequency of 3 s and 8 s at 50035 a 3 comes at 8 41 and then 8 43 and then neither again until 8 55

i was at 51434 on canada way it said to board on 6th st didn t take note of number at that stop 6th st and 12th ave

good afternoon does the 16th bus going downtown still run through granville st or does it detour somewhere else
mt servicechanges begin june 22 learn which newwest routes are affected

i m sure you guys gals are always on top of stuff lt 3
how do we request a fare refund for the delay on tues couldn t wait indefinitely for train so validated faresaver was not used
2 5 hr delay on a fare that s valid for 1 5 hrs is not acceptable charging for service not rendered is not acceptable
the bus wasn t even full so many people saw and were disgusted k end of my rant
thank you i definitely will
an awesome video from showing one day of activity on system
the escalator at main st is not working again
i may be mistaken wasn t it the provincial government that decided to download the cost and political fallout to
they ve had one of those yellow gates up for two days know there s nothing on the web sight however
the 156 driver for the 3 29 bus at austin amp nelson st literally just let people off and drove off leaving women with young cont
cont children in the heat and the rest of us standing here for no reason bus wasn t even full absolutely ignorant
translink send a memo to your drivers to stop honking the horn like a toddler sitting on their father s lap
you need to update the bus schedules on your site i m late for work cuz your site gave me incorrect info i m so pissed

why does the skytrain at burrard smell like burning oil ud83d ude13
very impressed with your customer service rep at braid she went out of her way to help a blind lady and her assistance dog
i guess customers who take the 555 and transfer to a coq bus at braid will have to pay more starting june 22
was on train 106 did the breaker blow
burning smell on the east bound platform of granville not sure what s up
just now 10 granville bus driver chatting w his fellow driver and missing passenger s stop

bcteachers healthcare need money and yet we can afford omthebridge we don t hate yoga we hate wasting money

nwhen will the public know the results of the plebiscite
just pulling into edmonds car 028 guy with pill bottle in lap may need some help
we ve stayed with him now approaching metrotown
and an attendant has responded
very happy to pay for a fare but all the ticket machines at burrard station are unable to process my request via debit or credit
no easier to just walk to granville use the machines regularly but they aren t reliable
thank you for the prompt reply
you guys are terrible
screws up every commuters life for hours on end then offer a replacement ticket fuck you translink
i really wish would stop cancelling my bus that i use to get to work cancel a bus that s on an every 2 minute route instead
keep this in mind every time you cancel a bus someone has to do something dangerous to get to work on time safety first
55134 been waiting here since 6 20 for a 335
transkink needs to update the restriction sign on busses no smoking no food no radio damn shoulda left my boombox at home
the 341 guildford is almost 10 minutes late annoyed
the 341 at stop 55991 is almost 15 minutes late annoyed
highlighting this as a potential customer service issue for translink to look into to ensure wifinetwork isn t having problems
passed out man on westbound train distressing heading to 22nd st
did i hear this correctly the bus 555 is doing trips to abby and chwk in the coming future

i need to buy a day pass today but i only have cash i ll also have to take a bus to a station what could i do
i m at west coast express maple meadows station in maple ridge bc
the canada line is seriously underbuilt was there no demand forecasting stubby little packed trains tiny stations yvr
oh sweet thanks that will help a lot for me personally
gee that s not at all helpful can t you yes be specific what emergency requires the whole station to be locked down
please ask your 143 sfu bus drivers to wait for passengers when running early especially when they see people running to bus
not to mention inbound and outbound trains having to share one track held at stations for a long time during rush hour
even better thanks a lot for the help cheers
good job on taking out the obstructive barriers at the canada line at waterfront helps pedestrian traffic flow immensely
stop 50461 bus was clearly late amp couldn t take all passengers what s going on
does the 129 patterson still go to france s st does it still have the same the route
of course cancel a bus that serves the dt core during rush hour makes total sense
why are buses at 148th st going to surrey central so unreliable two cancelled buses and i m going to be late
esp when this one only comes every 10min on a good day the next bus probably won t be able to take everyone either
getting yelled at by a bus driver for getting on the 7 52 bus at 7 52 great way to start the day
fuck for making me late for my provincial ud83d ude12

seksanoreksik yup a tiny tiny fraction but hey dont let that fact stop you from being easily distracted
a ha my husband works for translink and i know what they are about
who am i kidding nobody gives a shit about accountability and spending woes they are going to throw good money at bad iquit
many want to drive a stake through translink the wallet draining vampire highway robbery
no interviews why doesn t this surprise me

canceled like permanently or just today s run why
it s really frustrating to have to submit a formal complaint after several tweets you guys should be able to count the tweets

why was nanaimo station half painted and then the painters left like 3 months ago i guess they are not coming back
he was escorted off by one of your staff at the 22nd station i think things will be okay
validators are not working at new westminster station eastbound
why do your trains randomly switch routes without notification sometimes ie vcc becomes expo
it did happen today but i have switched and rerouted i ll get the number of the train next time for you
today is the first day has super disappointed me up til now i swore was worst publictransit 7busessouth nonegoingnorth

still no word on what you will be doing for the riders most affected by last week s skytrain breakdown monthly passholders
14th ave and kingsway in burnaby
u guys tweeted last week that u ll announce it later but u never did
cheesy answer you announced publicly you would do something hw about announcing publicly what that will be
announcement on skytrain can not be heard on my train car nobody can hear it sounds like a whisper volume up better
since it s 2 75 when i get on the bus how would i upgrade
just arrived at royal oak and its train 144
oh i apologize i should clarify volume for stations are fine it s the announcement from skytrain control that s super low
i called customer relations and they told me an announcement about compensation from last friday will be made tmw is this true

a drunk idiot just delayed the train for about a minute with his hand stuck in the door at broadway city hall
and the only staff was chatting with his buddy up the stairs
am i right in thinking only can give it out tickets is that why there is such a police presence on the trains
just curious why has the train been so full lately it s absolutely packed even at 9pm not angry just wondering
i get that track maintenance needs to be done but we ve been waiting 25 minutes at main street for a train to get on
the platform at main st is now pretty darned close to unsafely crowded
when i see spiders on the bus i think it s unfair they got on without paying are they counted as fare evaders
last time i did that they just said it was track maintenance now closer to 30 minutes no train
oh i see thanks ud83d ude04
hey it s been 20 minutes since a jam packed eastbound train at main street please advise
end of service seems to have been 9pm

that s a new record 5 cops hanging out at a skytrain station is this what we pay you for
missed a bus before this one because the number i got from the text was 5 minutes later than what was on the pole
so for next time should i trust these unreliable texts or the unreliable times posted on the poles
is there a police incident at columbia station why so many cops doing basically nothing here at least they should check tix
then why 5 cops standing around doing nothing is that proper
why is there such a increased police presence at train stations

still no response
like beauty complexity is in the eye of the beholder i predict you are going to have a nightmare on your hands are you hiring
why do you have to crank the heat on buses everyone is dressed up appropriately for the weather and this is overkill
unfortunately i am at the back of a crowded b line so this is not feasible
anyone know when and will get their shit together re always full c21 and c23 buses world class city bull
what about people who work on sea island but not enough to justify a monthly pass
someone appears to have left a backpack on expo line train 335 i think travelling westbound spotted at gateway
translink in fairness your project team has only had six years to figure it out i m sure they ll stumble on a solution any day now
i ve been waiting for the 144 from sfu for half an hour now is this a three bus no show
does a successful tapout have any visual feedback high pitched sound is impossible to place could be coming from any machine
i m on the 43 bus right now i politely asked the driver 3 times for the back door and he didn t open it to let me off
just got charged 3 zones for 1 stop trip downtown couldn t confirm tapout despite best efforts now my pass won t work
where s the 6 05 155 from 22nd st it s been 5 mins away for the last 10 mins according to your real time tracker what a joke
screen was green but still got dinged guess the gates will make it a lot more obvious when you start closing them
fix your real time tracker or stop calling it that
why do i pay translink 91 mo to have not full buses ignore my plain view self directly at the bus stop
why is the 480 going to ubc always late multi times i ve stood at bridgeport while the bus sits nis past the depart time

great faresavers will b useless amp i have 2 get a visa 2 load by bank i guess i ll plead poverty amp get a free ride like so many
when the bus replies to you two hours later
most inefficient non user friendly system discriminating against people who live in the burbs amp don t want credit cards nice
123 bus left new west stn early was to leave at 7 25 got there at 7 23 pathetic
ok seriously wtf the bus was supposed to come at 7 26 and now it s coming at 7 46 stop 56533
gon na miss my appointment now thanks a lot goodfornothing
can i get on free like the freeloaders do
it did go by but it said not on service and flew by so fast is your employee not doing their job enjoying some free time
i was here at 7 20 6 min early and the bus flew by with a not in service sign at 7 25
yes is there anything i can do to improve
you should have back up plans in place i m going to be late now if they really made a report you would have initially told me
was going pretty fast for having a mechanical issue
is literally the most useless transit system in the world holy shit they do not do their jobs ever you have one job
is it too early to ask what new years eve schedule will be like trains running longer jan 1 2016 am free transit 2016 eve
the 402 always has issues the other day 2 busses didn t show up so i waited 1 5 hours all together
now where is the 746 i don t see it
any news on the 7 40pm 402 to 56549
only if you go to a machine online banking requires a credit card
also have to go to vancouver to get credit for faresavers already paid for many buses to do that
my bank doesn t do visa debit many don t they need to be a payee like shaw rogers etc
i m at the gully road stop heading to richmond center what s the next 401 i can catch heading towards stevston
i can understand why though they need to expire the fare saver when credited 2 exp 2 have machines everywhere
i m already on the 410 haha and my next stop is maycrest way
easier said than done it has taken online retailers a long time for same service req agreement from each bank
should b able 2 return faresavers purchase point taking day off work 2 spend several hours on buses is ridiculous
then they shouldn t have rolled out program until all current and or future users are accommodated it s been years
not ideal i agree but i m sure other payment options will come i believe that fare machines req cash when new
awesome thank you y all get 10 10 for the past 2 days
don t forget that this was forced on them by bc gov t a huge job to make system work on huge transit system
as simone who works in it i know first hand how long it can take to implement a financial system of this scale
that i know makes me i ll at the cost
falcon knew it didn t work before he implemented it like bcesis we will pay 4 costly boondoggles like this 4 years
this just makes me like riding my bike even more
i believe translink said that it would cost more than revenue recovered and advised against it
can you still use fare savers until when
so tired of these triple billing schemes of the fiberals
i got my cc on the weekend registered amp loaded it online amp used it 4 1st yesterday 4 me it worked flawlessly
for me much easier with cc to get to medical appointments in new west from langley than with fare savers
thanks for the quick reply
i listened 2 a senior bank who was refused a visa amp just lost hubby she is using a pass he bought her last month
is the 301 being delayed cancelled today
4 some yes not 4 all i bought a lot of faresavers 1 zone concession b4 rollout now have 2 take day off 2 get credit
the 598 from sherwood near thallon st at 2 32pm didn t come then the translink on the phone hung up on me where is this bus
okay thanks i ll be taking the last one at 9 40 just worried about it being cancelled or not
they need 2 keep faresavers take cash amp passes until cc is working properly 4 all encourage all 2 get out of cars
one zone fare savers are still valid
they tweeted i had to go to vancouver
accoding to translink web site cvm s at skytrain seabus amp wce you have latter in p meadows amp maple ridge
when will the fare gates closed
i load is it 2 75 for the skytrain or can i just purchase tickets
i was told by rep on phone that this was true initially but more options will become available in another month or 2
she advised me to hold existing fare savers til then i have a few singles amp 2 zones
thanks i ll tide over and check it out this weekend hopefully saves me losing a day of pay
should be easy enough to program cvm s to credit fare savers to account and cancel afterwards
call them i was told that other options for fare saver credit will come i called them in october to check
i called last week amp got someone who could only give some info having to use twitter 2 get info after write ups today
i must be getting the hang of tapping in and out tried to tap in at our security door at work
from info on the web site you can load a cc using debit card at cvm they show a menu with debit pay option
when i tapped in at joyce station why did i get charged 4 10 and then tapped out at broadway stat and got charged another 2 10
that they do would rather pay online than have to make a trip into town
bad experience today removed from bus after paying amp boarding busfull 97 noservice unreliable
using regular planes there s no direct transit from the victoria airport to u2026 u00a0victoria seriously and people complain about
i know i was giving you a compliment people keep complaining about you but to me skytrain is the best thing ever
are skytrains faster at night or stop for less time at stops always seems quicker to get home nighttime on expo line
thx have you figured out how to work this with teachers going on a field trip do we load everyone on 1 card or does every 1 2
1 2 4 and 5 yr old need their own card
2 2 4 and 5 yr old need their own card
must be the alcohol then twitter replies are definitely faster though don t lie
a reporter did a rider test 2day tapped on amp off and overcharged refund applies when u write to translink still glitches
you know i love mark ii second generation trains with light up maps you should get more of those lol ud83d ude02
wowthanks i didn t know mark iii was coming it looks bigger and better similar to mark ii ud83d ude0d can you love trains so much lol

vancouver should take an incredible opportunity to turn the dark cold inefficient expo line stations into inviting places
hey i m concerned been waiting for the n9 night bus east bound for coquitlam station but the 2 09 a m did not show

abrupt stop outside edmonds everything ok
wce the conductor just announced that train 1 will be approx 5 min late into waterfront freights
train 148 nit moving outside edmonds

is the problem train at edmonds the reason for trains held at commercial broadway
what is the impact on expo line trains at this time
it s okay only morning rush we don t have anywhere important to be ud83d ude1c
when a train delay means you should have stayed in bed for an extra hour and you woke up at 4 30 for no reason blessed
what s going on with expo line
is the skytrain broken again
whats the problem does it take long time
yay broken skytrain a few min 15 min apparently
so i hear did monthly pass holders ever see compensation for the outages of the year i know there was a free day a while back
but 1 free day is useless foe monthly folks like myself
i wish gave out free coffee
hurry the f up
how is the m line this morning
is the issue at edmonds going to affect the service from scottroad skytrain to surrey central station
time to replace all the old trains at expo line this held up is second time of the week

how long is it going to take to clear
about 20 minutes ago tweeted that they have crews on the way
why can t u guys move the trains that have been sitting outside the station for 20 minutes into the station so ppl can get off
how much longer to removed that train it s been over 15 mins now people are starting to get aggrivated
uh oh problem at edmonds skytrain station

can you send an empty train to commercial
translink broadway platform 3 amp 4 at capacity please send an empty train or no one s getting on or off here
even lines not affected i would have thought keeping people moving as much as possible is better method
when will the 19 resume route on pender instead of diverting onto hastings
he gets special treatment typo

is the skytrain working
any chance of a relief train at commercial broadway it s brutal out here
expo amp millennium line platform closed at broadway station b c platform is full both directions we need more trains
it would help if empty trains are dispatched to congested stations such as broadway been here for over 20mins
hey what is happening at commercial drive westbound w expo line crazy busy would be helpful to have more staff on platform
what the heck is going on at broadway no announcements
it might be worth an inquiry bc also open at homer
translink failed again stuck at commercial
any sign of a 26 bus coming to 51186 been waiting here for half an hour now
is there an alert up i don t see one just walked into that what a disaster can t even get onto the platform
making another formal complaint but still wan na whinge about the disgusting driver who smokes on his bus before picking us up
is the millennium line headed to vcc from commercial delayed due to this at all
thanks but no on platform info other than repeated announcements to stay behind yellow line more staff info much appreciated
why isn t there any announcements about the delay just a mob of people getting angry they can t get to work
or even just signage explaining the situation would be a good step cheers
translink skytrain worker tweaking something at the back of stuck train at main which is now moving yeah

is it allowed to vape on the skytrain is vaping allowed on your trains what is the rule i m about to punch someone out
we are curious about this also what gives
thank you for the reply i advised the young lady to stop amp that it isn t allowed information is better maybe she was unaware
get your shit together buncha cunts
doesn u2019t that seem like a major problem if i don u2019t know i go to a negative balance then i u2019m locked out of transit for 30 minutes
bad enough a bus just did a uturn on the hill to go south
it didn u2019t because it failed to register my tap off even though it said it did so that u2019s what caused the negative balance
so i try to use it this afternoon negative balance add money online still can u2019t use it
i figured lucky too far down the hill to turn around
already did on another related issue my point is there are still some major implementation issues
yes and it can take up to 2 hours when customer service issues a credit for a system tap out problem
which means i can u2019t use transit for 2 hours when it happens without adding even more money at a local skytrain terminal
for negative balances due to a tap out issue it needs to implement an email or something otherwise it just locks people out
right but i get no notice i u2019m in a negative balance until it tells me i can u2019t use it then it takes 2 hours to add money
any news on where the c30 might be
can you tell me why the 104 bus off of annacis island is running late
i thought that was the whole point of the 6 i was required to put on there in the first place
dunkirk and hornby been here for 20 mins n no bus
yes as previously noted that still didn u2019t fix the 2 hour problem as previously noted as well
and you u2019re now telling me my best solution is to autoload even more money on the card beyond the 6
why was it cancelled
is the 301 to brighouse looking to be on time for 6 19 at stop 55196
3 104 bus late why
much like how if you don u2019t tap out on the canada line it charges for 3 zones in spite of that line being a max of 2 zones
i thought these shuttle buses were timed with the wce been waiting 10m in the rain for c38rs
i u2019m just going to end this conversation now as it u2019s going nowhere
has the 155 at 22nd street skytrain be cancelled or delayed
well thank you for informing people who rely your systems to get places waiting in the rain before work is lovely
poco we were just picked up thanks
what is with delays
there hasn t been a train for 5 mins at waterfront millenium line do you know what s the delay the platform is full

please explaine why so many delays on the train from downtown
what am i supposed to infer when the next bus feature has now listed twice in a row and has for the past 10 minutes what

it s cool i m sure arrive no later than 6 meant show up whenever you feel like it
it has taken me an hour to get on the train from burard

tell your drivers to stop running over people it would be appreciated breaking pedestrian struck by translink bus
are prepaid paper fares faresaver daypass still available and valid for travel
whoever is driving the 791 that is supposed to be eb at burbidge st at 5 49 needs to be removed from the route 20 mins late for
2 weeks now causing total chaos for all passengers and the next bus sitting on a bus with 3 ppl while the other is behind jam
packed with people this is unacceptable and all because 1 bus driver can t handle this route
lesson for your drivers stop at the assigned bus stop when there are 5 6 ppl waiting 22 on burrard amp robson
if this was in l a translink would have a whole other meaning
where is the two 9 and one 99 for 52102

just wish it was a little more spread out they come in spurts of 3 buses at a time and it s hard to catch
like that s going to make the services any better that s your guys answer to every problem and the same problem happens always
hey users of skytrain watch for scammers pretending to be from peddling credit cards will be contacting to report

oops needed an easy way to differentiate the cards quickly between five kids serial numbers aren t enough
my train has been sitting outside new west for nearly 10 mins is that to be expected will miss the 11 40 320 from central now
if we forget is there any recourse
yes i know u2014but during this initial period when it u2019s easy to forget bc u don u2019t need to open faregates can we apply for a refund
and why it wasn t the delay on the translink all when i looked up which bus to catch
what s the point of a real time website if you don t this is just stupid why bother terrible service and thanks for nothing
the least translink can do is update the schedule
i m assuming more breakdowns on the 135 this morning looks like we re on a double cancellation today or is there union action
what s going on no bus for past 10 minutes
waiting at the bus stop eb e 41 ave fs sherbrooke st 5 46 the bus never stopped now late for work
columbia stn westbound platform sign that shows train direction showing this platform is closed but stn is operating normally

the 555 that jst left the surrey pick up passed by half empty and didnt even bother to pick anyone up ud83d udc4d ud83c udffb ud83d ude12
2 zone pass in zones 1 2 will it work on the 97b line bus traveling to coquitlam all buses
lol there s no point instead of this maybe speak to your shitty bus drivers who wouldn t let me on the bus at edmonds station
even though there was still room on the bus i m insanely mad i m going to be late because of your inconsiderate driver
another one jst passed us up too ud83d ude22 why bother having a stop here if you cant accomodate now we hve 12 people running late too
has the 160 been exceptionally busy this morning as last 2 busses have skipped port moody stn although first may have been early
is slamming the doors in ypur customers face and waving as they drive away what you want to advertise as good service hah really
even thou the 97b is in zone 3 all buses are now zone 1 even if they travel in zone 3 ill leave my 2 zone pass unscratched
that s same on king george waterfront bound too on last weekend
why are a the 125s to bcit currently cancelled all trips are currently crossed out
ruins my commute but makes sense are double busses being put into place to replace smaller busses to make up for increase
why was 7 27 cancelled without notice i had to cab to work
what time is the 143 leaving at 53299
is this bus cancelled weird for it it happen 2 times in a week
the 7 50 bus didnt arrive but thanks
my suggestion would be to limit the of people boarding at the carvolth exchange so the bus can allow for those at hwy1 off ramp
what time does the wce station at waterfront close today
why has it not shown up on the app i have to transfer 3x so i check the app vs getting alerts
some guy punched the side of my bus this morning i mean i kind of get it 4 49 s go by and we can t get in
seems ridiculous that we can t get to work without a 20 30 minute wait in the morning why are the wb 49 s so full no relief
i don t condone violence but i also don t think the bus driver needed to stop and yell asshole at him creates more delays

bravo another 125 bcit misadventure ud83d udc4f what happened to the earlier buses
your service on the 125 is terrible the line is looping into the skytrain station this is ridiculous
every day the 430 going to richmond is packed have to wait for next one again 20mins any plans to put in a double bus
aside from that there s constant overcrowding on the 100 s in am ever consider running a special 22 to marine cambie no stops
bcit students send a complaint on website more complaints more they will change it cancelled buses are ridiculous
could you give me any info on the skytrains this morning 29th ave st is packed i ve seen about 6 trains go by packed
driver of bus 9755 seems to be trying to toss passengers around repeated hard late braking someone is going to get hurt
what happened to reliable bus service third day in a row close to half hour late fixit fixitnowplease stop58089

what s going on with skytrain this morning keeps stopping outside the stations
wheres the bus im late for school

also bus drivers always giving free rides no wonder why buses are full all the time and the people that pay late for work bs

going matheson marine to horseshoe bay why is option 2 more then option 1 both start in vancouver
is there a reason why buses never show up the 144 going to sfu at sperling is always late around 12 55 1 54 really frustrating
if i have a monthly pass it is a set price for the month how can i be charged more especially if i have a 3 zone
what happens if you forget to tap out if you have a monthly pass doesn t it not matter how often you travel in out of system
so was it charging you as if you were taking a single trip not on a monthly pass
sperling station apparently there s a nis bus that went by the loop and continued up duthie
it charged me 1 50 added fare i have a 2 zone pass i called customer service and they reversed it later
will translink provide a sensible solution to this problem it s ridiculous that this is still happening
i never travel outside of one zone for the most part and constantly forget there s multiple zone fare rates
i just got back on at the east end and the sta confirmed there is no reader at the west end
pretty sure 160 doesnt go to sfu
translink how s the train that got injured during the wind storm doing recovering in the hospital car 321

how many zones do you have to pay if you re starting from ladner and going to waterfront
yes and i m telling you that the driver failed to stop at several vancouver bus stops to pick up waiting amp visibly upset people
i ve already reported it here it s up to translink to manage how it gets recorded

is doing this as well bcpoli
affected stops were cambie carrall main amp commercial as mentioned i already reported it here

exclusive deals for london drugs how much was the payoff
i assume not if you have a monthly pass same as now
no buses it s disgusting that we pay 250 month for express service on longest commute amp translink won t ensure we have a bus
still a stupidly inflated price because they can
exactly my point instead of exploiting tourists they exploit vancouver yay
however still cheaper amp faster than a cab and it s only 1 way i ll begrudgingly accept the change
which is exactly what they want shrugging and accepting this bs sigh
i actually think they were caught off guard when the fare saver printer went bankrupt
yo nobody wants a receipt for a 2 75 fare it should be optional not default vancouver
next a visit north van package a return cruise from dt a nv beer or cocktail tourism
lol don t try to pawn your work off on me collect that customer feedback bwoyyyy
that makes no sense but then this is translink so i am not surprised that no positive action will be taken
does management just decide like hey we ll just send our drivers home for the night noshowbusses
that driver should be held accountable for intentionally not doing his job
is there a problem with rogers in receiving text from 33333 can t receive the estimated depart time
haha loving this bus driver commentary don t usually get any on the 410

this would be good for people with disabilities as well as help others keep their valuables phone wallet secure when tapping in
so obviously u knew about this event in advance why did u not plan to have extra trains running during this time
what s happening with the skytrain this morning hundreds waiting at commercial broadway stn
did the 8 19 160 stop 51374 get cancelled again

busy buses 3 8 should skip from gastown to chinatown instead add a local c bus circle route from carnegie to main skytrain

your website shows this so which one is actually happening
i bought a card online want to get a monthly pass for november preloaded but it doesn t specify which month you re buying for
perfect thanks for confirming 1 more thing will books of passes still be available in dec have overseas family coming

so if i load now that will be for november already newbieanxiety
if only taking th bus was that easy

why are there always five expo lines in a row at nw stn and then maybe if we re lucky one millennium will finally come along
well then maybe tell your workers to warn people before 4 or 5 come along so we re not missing buses absolutely ridiculous
when your train keeps chiming expo line to king george amp then randomly stalls on the track why translink
seriously the abrupt breaking on the skytrain is super sketch bcpoli
it s moving again there was an announcement after i sent my tweet
three trains are backed up at nanaimo station headed towards king george lots of people waiting any idea whats up
was at patterson none is there to tell ppl about the sitch waited 6 trains w others before checking twitter get on it pls
would it kill to wait until after the trains completely shut down extensive maintenance delays while still open is notcool
now we re stuck at the stadium stn for over 5 mins what s going on
just call em a bunch of dildos lolololol
so fed up of the 250 never showing up when it should it s on it s way yeah it s not what a joke
pls the storm is cominf wheres my bus
how fast can you run
trains are packed leaving downtown just like rush hour at 10 30 pm
ahhh thanks just didnt expect sro packed trains coming from the downtown
didn t realize they were doing both lines that explains the very large crowds
see ya later ud83c udf07
i was waiting at wb marine dr fs capilano rd and the 240 drove past without slowing down do you not service that stop at night
those qualification requirements are laughable considering the jokers that have run your company before
dear i don t have the requirements but i do have common sense and the willingness to play bad cop payme
we need more light rail rapid transit infrastructure in greater vancouver and free parking ro encourage skytrain commuting
transit is more slow than before when it comes to trolley buses
which is worse dc metro or vancouver s skytrain two thespians weigh in
any idea what happened to first c44 this morning was a no show not good for wce commuters
i m sorry to hear that and hope everyone is ok thanks for update

57631 the 6 59 701 never showed up
the no 8 bus just passed me at 58125 and was nearly empty next one isn t for 9 minutes why
bus 2246 6 has the heat on bust thought i would pass out not necessary it s not cold out
i don t know what it is about this driver but he is on average 8 minutes later to my stop than any other driver of this route
yep get the same old scripted run around nothing is ever done been like this for weeks don t bother sending the complaint link
any reroutes or problems with busses crossing the granville st bridge today
detour has ended but 43 ubc route still significantly impacted line at joyce is huge and no bus for over 15 min
that s two days in a row now multiple 135west buses aren t stopping at renfrew and hastings around this time
passed by 3 full 25 busses
you can view cancelled buses on our translink app or our website cheers s
my concern is your tweet implied service had returned to normal which it hasn t will still be delays for another 30 min

like only every second bus came and the ones that did were full
now that all busses are one zone the 240 is so busy it takes two full busses before one comes that has room commutinghell
why is the 15 turns into the 50 not on schedule at all this week been waiting at cambie 12th forever again

got on now so not an issue for today though i m due to start work in 13 mins and won t be there till 10
get your shit together i was late to class cos 2 buses didn t show up
what i m getting at is the fact this happens way too often what can i do about it
41 driver let people off a block ahead and then didn t stop to let me board instead he skipped my stop what s his problem
bit bullshit if bus driver is late and blames traffic when you re the third stop in the route after school drop off hours
this is great thanks
wtf on your busiest route four days in a row getyouracttogether
that u2019s sad that has to be a fixable problem
this is not news cc
will you introduce visa debit or debit card to online payment not everyone has a credit card
seriously arrive at bus stop for 9 00am and the next bus isn t apparently coming until 9 34am not acceptable
why is the 27 bus late every morning by 5 10minutes at every single stop time stop 51699
stop 51529 last two scheduled busses have not come missing first class this is why no one trusts you
doesnt make me any less late
bus lost its pole on the lines at davie and grandville all buses are stopped
mark this time driver on 99 b8121 just changed lanes from r to curb in intersection no excuse nothing blocked him from curb
and no i did not call him on it or get his run sheet number did i mention he halted two lanes of traffic amp missed an suv
also the translink isn t showing the live times what s the issue
don t forget guys if you have a smart phone you can download a free translink app that gives up to the minute info
no buses home now either translink shambles
where is the 340 to scottsdale 12 mins late
19 mins late and counting
i was here at 10 15 bus scheduled for 10 19
ok the 10 49 bus just picked me up 3 mins early maybe a timetable adjustment could help
translink need a serious shake up not offering value for money or a dependable service
in case you don t know glass on sb bus stop at 31st and dunbar is shattered and on ground vancouver
we need lines painted for the 145 bus stop at sfu like at production it s like no one knows how to line up without them
it will be a problem because i didn u2019t receive any notifications about my balance so even if i topped up u2026
u2026i still wouldn u2019t be able to go through the gate until it goes through
lessons for on fixing its broken business model answer lies with to allow for real change
good day to you question how much do those bike locker rentals cost thanks
oh also panel above door r3 on canada line carriage 115 is loose and dangling just so you know lt 3
there s some css problems with at least but probably other pages with insets too

thank you for the bike info and you re welcome cheers

there is no rest of the route those buses serve wce people are already 30 90 mins late cbuses run infrequently amp should be held
why do wce riders pay the most in fares and get the worst service wce serves outlying areas and cbuses should be held
stop 50077 where have the 210 211 been been here for over half an hour
that was kinda useless they canceled the bus have 2 wait 4 the next 1 i d love to c a report on how often 214 gets cancelled

my pleasure good things should be shared for sure
wce riders get 40 90 min delay and translink does not hold community shuttle buses so rural riders get delayed even more
september monthly pass paper
wce riders pay highest fares and translink does not help us when there are train delays buses leave empty amp we walk or wait
wce serves rural areas translink should hold buses or add more when there s long train delays we shouldnt have 2 pay 4 cabs
any reason why the c3 hasn t shown up to new west station stop number 61656 was supposed to be here at 5 40
it still hasn t shown up people are getting upset and antsy
hey what s with the 50 three buses headed south went by in the last half an hour one going north just showed up
no i meant 6 40 and it s now late for the 6 55 and there s a large lineup for the shuttle around the block and people are pissed
bus drivers are leaving late for the wce riders ppl waiting at stops on route are getting left behind c29
have they stopped running the c3 and decided not to inform anyone no sign of it anywhere
seriously why can t the c28 wait for the passengers to get off the wce 2 nights in a row and the 178 is cancelled c mon now
dear please update your bus schedules this is the 2nd time you ve been wrong in as many days
just had a few nis shuttle busses drive past and we are shouting at them and they look at us and keep driving
the c3 left nweststn 6 mins early at 6 34 the c4 is 10 mins late what s up lines down into station
was waiting at the stop just outside granville island
yes i see that now and it is 22 minutes late we need answers
when is the last 606 bus in the evening on a weekday
this is the reason the c29 was full and people on route are left to wait another hour
2 nights in a row now wce pulled in and the bus left other busses waited can t wait 2 minutes ridiculous
alright thank you sooo much i really appreciate it you ve been super helpful d
really that s brilliant
train 1 arrived at mission 2 hours late
is the 210 vancouver coming soon to phipps exhange the 6 51 didn t show up and there s a big line waiting
thanks for driving past me x2 while waiting at the bus stop it s the universes way of telling me i need exercise i guess
i d suggest having real time displays waiting for a 41 at joyce stn bay4 since 20 minutes seriously infuriating
2nd time today 49th is late again 7 02 to 7 14 now 7 15 still not here wtf stop wasting my time
i could write a cute 50s pop hit about standing around waiting at the busstop or hey solve the bus clumping problem please
wan na see a photo of my ice cream melting at the bus stop
the bus just arrived finally
the driver of v7208 on a eb 41 is a good man waited for a running lady top marks
i did as well as last night tell your drivers to wait it s the c28 line people are trying to get home
ah sorry yes completely my mistake just confused a tad absolutely going to pay but worried about timeline is all
for a service that s supposed to be every 7 mins why has there been no bus 3 at stop 59536 for 22 mins
since it is 15 of my monthly wages i need to be sure i pay in time before it goes up
you re wrong bus clumping is easy 2 fix manage it using gps and give drivers instructions get creative
nah no need to dispute i made the mistake i must take responsibility thanks for the link
53190 c24 going to lougheed station this isn t the first time either

hi there any chance you can help me locate a fare dealer that has 1 zone faresavers stock south surrey or newton
you guys seriously have a loud as hell track grinder running when people are trying to sleep what s wrong with you
had a thought the other day why don t you video the buskers on the seabus walkway van side for twitter clips many work hrs
many of the buskers are so talented but get no other recognition by translink the other day new busker sang as if in a musical
listening to this wonderful singer he sounded as if he was in les miserable or miss saigon any idea who he is
okay thanks have a safe journey home now and sleep well
thank you for responding well it does show but if its the origin point it won t make much sense there was a huge line up
i lt 3 transit the better it gets the happier i d be ncertain circumstances r unavoidable bt its b8r kp ur riders well informed

it s the old machines six person line up just to get a ticket thanks for the quick reply
thanks 4 retailers and none i think i m done they are coming back right pretty sure none on the north shore
and with no fare cards what do we do until then poorplanning
if everyone has to have one why limit daily sales especially to a number that will half fill a train
there was a highly confrontational male threatening another passenger he exited at edmonds red hoodie sports bag sunglasses
where is the 335 heading to surrey central from gateway it s been a solid 20 minutes i ve been waiting for it
large line up at bay 4 everyone is waiting for the c29 but it s missing
but for the next month 200 day and no retailer has farebooks anymore this company is a joke an absolute joke
so there s 6 000 available for sale until november 1 what s your daily average ridership
yeah i got texted when it was going to come after i got on it thanks
only one of four ticket dispensers works at waterfront station no wonder people cheat
at stop 55656 where is 324 seriously
when i tried to text a bus stop number it won t text me back for some reason _
you can already load monthly passes at the stadium customer service centre possibly also at the cvms in stations
how i don t see that option just wce passes
thanks that is apparent pls get proactive and explain what is isn t avail which system to use etc via news media
if i take the 555 from la glory to burnanby can i use a 1 zone mo pass starting oct 5
oh now it shows up 5 minutes later i texted 56884 and my provider is chatr

followed map and visited 16 retailers gt 10km walk there are no 1z faresaver 7 11 said no more ever
sign at 7 11 dunsmuir seymour same msg at 16 other retailers some have 2z faresavers but now worthless
yes it s for a fare infraction and he is on hold with them if you would be able to dm the number that would help
are the 178 or c28 going to show to pick up us up after getting off the west coast express
unbelievable scrounging bus fare so can get to event tomorrow and be responsible nothing like organization
port moody station 61912
yes what about the c28 you got ta communicate don t you work with the wce make an announcement or something
you missed my point i can t buy 1z anywhere 2z is avail but should now be priced same as 1z why buy 2z when all points r1z
ok will try that later thanks
will this affect the vcc line going from lougheed to new west
i visited every 20 locations on this map incl inside granville stn there are no 1z faresaver
you got ta communicate more you are absolutely terrible at this fix it it s happened before
no worries if translink could post at least a ticket number on icbc s record it would be appreciated
that way i could have paid it at the insurance broker now i can t even do that and have no car til tomorrow
paid the ticket at the brokers office
where s the 7 11 arrival of the 324 from stop 55652
thanks but not a user friendly site on mobile a simple call to the wce and have them announce cancellations is so friggin easy
do you guys follow me around and make sure all the busses i need to catch are cancelled
so not really that convenient
why are there no 10 trip booklets anywhere in downtown amp are busses now 2 10 because of your inability to print and deliver
i hope it resolves soon

thanks will do just annoying as about a dozen of us are stranded then the bus zips along to dc half empty and arrives 5m early

so i bought a monthly pass because i have work tomorrow at the skytrain can i add the paper one to my card
oh i do i have one from when i was in school in the summer
i needed to buy a paper pass in order to get to work tomorrow morning
so i m assuming that s a no to putting the monthly pass onto my card even at the skytrain station
like my dream set up would be to have stored value as well as the monthly pass so that i could transit on buses fine and
then have it take from the stored value when i travel across zones via skytrain
there s a whole band serenading the 99 b line tonight vancouver
hi is the monthly pass effective starting from oct 1 or is it only valid after oct 5

how many times has the 0823 64b city bound been on time in last two weeks timetablefail translink betterinthecar
skytrain staff counting the no of riders only 6 not the point public transit should be available whenever people need it
i love when i have to run my ass to the bus it shows up early just as i get to the stop and completely misses me
i was waiting at the 51285 stop maybe four feet away i even waved at the bus when i noticed she wasnt changing lanes
i get that this stuff happens it s just really inconvenient
so when the 1zone everywhere goes into effect monday if i m coming from 3rd zone and going to 1st zone what do i scratch on
the 1 zone bus pass or does it matter since it s all 1 zone haha
i take a bus to braid then skytrain from braid to 22nd st then bus into vancouver amp richmond from there

translink put an ad for one zone buses on the 2 zone bus passes targeted advertising fail
please turn ac on in train 239 expo to waterfront super hot in here
when and where can you purchase campos cards from
another morning leaves people behind at the carvolth stn amp can t pick up any passengers at the 156 st stop the bus is too full
still waiting for to address this issue
502 that just passed fraser and 148 wb displayed bus full and drove by no one standing up in back half of bus happens often
ok i see any idea where and when more wool be sold i live in surrey
hi where the explicitive is the 129 the 7 43 and the 7 58 busses didn t show up
hey there s only one functional ticket machine at marine stn during rush please fix it
hi where the explicitive is the 129 the 7 43 and the 7 58 bus didn t show up at 51465 stop and i ve been here for 30 min
there were at least two machines at bridgeport that did not display the buttons for purchasing single or multiple tickets
does the train that is just leaving king george now have a c on it s awfully cold in here
the only number in the car i can see is 348
that was the bus after the 7 58 unless you mean to tell me the bus had been 10 min late as it didn t get to 51465 until 8 08
everytime i get this driver on the 407 it ruins my morning miserable and rude sort it out we all have problems
and i just saw a machine at vancouver city centre not displaying those same buttons
then what about the 7 43 it was 10 min early
is there a 17 to oak coming at stop 50412
any news from the new west shuttle service to find out if the c3 is running late it s super late the 8 12 one disappeared
no but it was the one on the far right when looking at the row of machines
looks like the 8 12 c3 did not show up seriously from being late now they just don t show up fail
fack missed the train by 10 seconds waitforme firstworldproblems canadaline at in vancouver bc
200 ross looks like the 8 24 showed up however 8 12 must have taken a nap ud83d ude21
so this is what 5 days in a row that i have had issues on the bus system now the 160 is a no show at coquitlam centre station
no alerts or anything of course that would let us make alternative plans
is this the standard going forward now that busses are 1 zone just randomly not showing so we are forced to take alternatives
thanks a bunch have a great day ud83d udc4c
also the no show is an accordian bus and the one that showed up on time now is a regular bus
but that shouldn t cause any congestion on the bus or anything right
there is no alert on the website still
coquitlam station i don t memorize each stop id
no 246 since 8 20 at stop 58328
ew it s a soupy foggy mess out here marine drive skytrain station in vancouver bc
what about the canada line
shouldn u2019t the gates be working before you start the tapping pass when your employees aren u2019t there zero people tapped fail
you d pay the bus driver 1 50 exact fare for both oct 1 amp oct 2 n bus driver said this was impossible had no idea fyi o_o
why on earth are you starting this new 1 zone bus business after the 1st of the month instead of on the 1st
i was just told by this twitter account that the coach had a problem so i m not sure what you mean
so the 160 just decided not to show
they tell me to tweet to you you tell me to call them instead i ll work through my email and make up for my lost work time
if i scratch my one zone ticket for the first 2 days can i still bus in any zone after the 5th
we are here final translink shift with ud83d ude85 ud83d udcf0
which is more accurate the text message for next bus or the posted time sheet on the bus stop they are giving different info
here s a tiny one train car 004 has a seat with grapefruit drink spilled over it it s passing lougheed going west in a min
i honestly wonder what the risk managers at think about the narrow newwest stn platforms dangerous riskmanagement liability
all the machines right the westcoast station at waterfront
two weeks in a row the 25 to brentwood is constantly late what s up
will the skytrain gates be fully operational this month or can i still get a paper bus pass and be able to get on a train
10 15 people moved right to the edge of the kerb with a few holding their hands up unacceptable for this to happen translink
can translink arrange some luxury limos for those stuck at belfast treatypurcustomers
headed back to downtown busy day ahead alwaysonthego yvr u2013airport station
about to board a bus wish me luck zonemageddon
what s the number for customer service
does this really make sense for rush hour poor judgment customerservice
9 30 am 159 braid station bus is a noshow and is not even oct the 5
is it possible to buy faresaver tickets still
so i bought a 2 zone monthly pass for my regular 3 zone trip according to what i could figure out from your website am i safe
need message reminder for morning passengers please moveforward do not block doorways
bothersome that you have to buy a 2 zone pass for like 5 days of use
i don t remember buses being so tight for legroom u2026 ud83d ude02
ladner to bridgeport via 601 bus then bridgeport to vancouver via canadaline
workers have been great at helping me navigate around the city after i moved here from toronto thank you
i take the train seabus so i m stuck with a 2 zone anyways
good to know thank you
thanks what do i need to do for the next 4 days why did you start this on the 5th
i hope i don t miss my bus richmond
97 b line is 20 min late
does it depend on where i tap in each time
translink all good 402 bus was a little late but better safe than sorry
was full just passed us
busses seem to be normal now
your ticket machine is poo la la ud83d udca9
and i won t be charged addfare unless i cross the second zone boundary on train seabus right 1 2
if i skytrain from 3 to 2 bus into 1 will taking skytrain within zone 1 charge add fare assuming all within an hour
also if i tap in in 1 in 2 tap out and tap in at the same stn then tap out in zone 3 will that be counted as 2x 2 zone trips
faresavers are sold out everywhere already why didn t you guys stock more 1 zone
yes i read they went bankrupt in of september you guys also promised to have tix back on the shelves in a few weeks
hi uh i didn t realize the 50 bus isn t going to granville island what s happening the bus driver didn t announce anything
the moment when you realize hates you ud83d ude02
i take 157 to lougheed sky train and takes the train to burrard is a 2 zone pass good enough
when is the 405 supposed to come on stop 56932
can t get fare savers anywhere but this kind of tourist exploitation is ok you disgust me sickening
basically i m going to drive to work for the month of oct so i don t spend more than 2 zone price i take seabus
we need more buses for the stop 52356 at port royal they are every 30 min
and also i would like to know where can i report a driver i have had bad experiences with some of them
next week teachers bring their classes amp board buses 4 free 4 field trips do they need 2 bring anything or drivers just know
why is the 97bline so unreliable and infrequent honestly a lot of busses are full at this hour needmorebusses
if i travel from marine drive station to bridgeport and then catch the 620 starting monday it would be 2 zone fare
the spiders at 22nd st platforms are coming back gross
they keep being sold out of faresavers books wherever i got and it s a huge pain i don t usually have cash on me
why can t i buy any more 1 zone faresaver tickets
so this is happening west georgia and howe street
this bus anywhere for 1 zone really doesn t have much impact for us here in surrey
a bus that just arrived at surrey ctrl station failed to stop for pedestrians not cool
does that have a limit of daily sales is it at expo level or beatty level
will this prevent the skytrain from breaking down bcpoli rebuildtransit cleanhouse accountability
can you get adult concession monthly passes yet
what about regular adults
what time do they open in the morning
also because i have a handypass will i still receive my discount
ok i ll grab it elsewhere i m not going for another week thanks for the reply
it would be super great if your drivers could actually stop when people clearly indicate the stop they want to get off at
aside from data collection with a 3 zone monthly card do i really need to tap
until the gates close that is
can i still get through the gates with just my faresaver ticket
do you guys have an eta of when the comapass monthly passes will be available for purchase online
and then buy the monthly pass or can i just top up that amount to make it a mp
ooo nm i read the website and i can get the concession very cool i m excited to get one and load it up for my skytrain use
it s all been sorted now then fingers crossed no glitches
ah makes sense are there still discounts on blocks of fare eg 10 one zone 21 50 also if i load a daypass will it auto
auto use the day pass or eg on my fourth trip will it refund the fare and use the pass instead
cart 152 had some sort of thing open don t think it s supposed to be
bus b9414 rt 26 3 12pm today driving is atrocious making me nauseous
signage on platform at edmonds is stuck on last train to waterfront has departed
no 246 bus at 3 19 in stop 58111
hi what happened to the 3 22 bus 555 the text system said a bus would come at 3 25 and that didn t come either
because i tap in and tap out in bus and i tap again in canadaline when i checked my stored value they charged me 4 20

i m at waterfront station in vancouver british columbia

waiting at 8771 lansdown road
20 people waiting for the 41 towards ubc in wesbrook village what s going on
as of monday if i were to take a bus then a skytrain would the bus be able to give a transfer greater than a 1 zone fare

an empty c75 just passed by and didn t stop so now i m going to miss my connecting bus 72nd at 126th
with my canadaline train as full as it is unless has train stuffers at the next station you re not getting on
maybe more than one 250 bus going downtown every 35 mins is more appropriate for this rush hour crowd
40 min late driver was a total ass and didn t stop any where to pick up and everyone was waiting for their late bus enraged
you could even swap it out for one of those 4 shiny mostly empty 239 buses you ve scheduled
we are on the bus now thank you so much for your help ud83d ude0a
c29 bus has not been on time at coq stn for several weeks following arrival of wce has this been explained
can you please explain this n
make it 5 239s
okay cause the cvms don t take amex and you can t tap pay at those when purchasing a ticket this is just confusing signage
there are now 70 people in line for the 791 bus at braid station heading to maple ridge what s up

at stop number 61656 and the c3 that was supposed to be here at 5 55 still hasn t shown up and there is a giant lineup
and we just came to a suddenstop on the canadaline whatsgoingon
is the 555 running late or had issues there atleast 3 busses worth of people standing in front of me at lougheed translink
being passed by over 5 135sfu buses has made me the human embodiment of irritable bowel syndrome
this twitter account has quickly become my place to rant about and what a terrible boyfriend it is smh

wow at least 200 people waiting for 1 bus can t wait till october 5th ouch
hi is the 50 waterfront picking up at granville island it didn t drop us off earlier
i m not enjoying the hour wait at the ferry terminal because there s no buses servicing the 4pm sailing
you need more buses on the 555 route this happens way to much
you know the delay a in august yea what happened for that delay i heard it was olympic village but what happened
why are there no trolley buses operating on the 019 all week instead they have been replaced by diesel s
still lots of delays on canadaline whatsgoingon
so a bike restriction on expo line and mill line but not canada line why not have a standard set rules that apply to all
any ideas how long the delay will be with the canadaline trying to get to the airport
when s the next bus coming to 51156
you re not really dinged it s credited back when you tap out silly system i didn t tap out and can t use it now
i had a problem with your service today and i want to make a complaint who do i contact
is this problem fixed now
what s the issue w cda line stopping outside stations fr broadway to bridgeport
i m still on main amp hastings it has been over 2 hours and i ve taken up heroin this is your fault lt jkg
no 6 46 bus from lougheed for the 555 you better send another one because this line is 60 deep
i made it to the airport in time thanks
blows my mind nothing like having to wait 35 min to get a bus
translink i thought this was supposed to have been resolved already ffs
thanks they fixed it for me and were fantastic service me dumb me wait for oct 5 to be lazy and not tap out
so there s a man agressively harassing customers for tickets and money at the stadium station at the top of the upper stairs
would be amazing if every store hadnt sold out of one zone passes how will i get to work now fail
nevermind really confusing transaction list on the website

is the 319 to scott road not coming by newton anymore cause its definitely been almost 30 minutes and no sign
i was just at poco station and said i needed to as stored value at that point
whats the status of the 430 na nb from bridgeport stn nb sb from metrotown stn n nthere seems to be a huge gap in service
its true the 160 is history after the evergreen lines comes in

hi so i usually buy the 2 zone monthly pass what should i be buying starting october shoppers drug mart wasn t very clear
